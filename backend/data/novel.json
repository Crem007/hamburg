                    "content": "My grandfather, Hu Guohua, hailed from the Hu family, which was renowned throughout the neighborhood as a lineage of prominent landlords. In their most splendid era, they owned a contiguous stretch of over forty residences along three hutongs in the city. The family\u2019s history boasted officials and merchants alike, and they had even contributed to the imperial grain transportation system during the Qing dynasty.\n\nThere's a folk saying that wealth doesn't last beyond three generations, and I've found it to be profoundly true. No matter if one possesses mountains of gold and silver, such wealth cannot withstand the wastefulness of profligate descendants.\n\nBy the time of the Republic of China, our family's fortunes began to wane, and it was during my grandfather's generation that the decline became evident. After the family assets were divided, Hu Guohua received a substantial inheritance, sufficient for a lifetime of comfort. Yet, he refused to tread a prudent path, which, admittedly, was partly influenced by the societal milieu of the time. Initially, he succumbed to gambling and later developed an addiction to opium, squandering the great fortune until nothing was left.\n\nIn his youth, Hu Guohua indulged in the \"five poisons\" of drinking, whoring, gambling, opium, and smoking. Eventually, he became so destitute that he didn't have a penny to his name. When a person is afflicted by nicotine addiction, it torments them to the core, making it unbearable to abstain. But without money, how could one indulge? Back when he was wealthy, the proprietors and attendants of the opium dens would lavish him with praise, treating him with the utmost attentiveness. However, once penniless, they would regard him as nothing more than a beggar, eager to hustle him out the door.\n\nDriven to madness by poverty, one's sense of decency and morals may no longer hold significance. Hu Guohua devised a scheme to con some money from his uncle. Knowing his nephew to be a spendthrift and an opium fiend, the uncle had never before been willing to lend him a cent. But this time, Hu Guohua lied, claiming he needed funds to take a wife. The uncle, moved to tears by the prospect of his wayward nephew finally engaging in a respectable endeavor, thought that marrying a virtuous wife might rein him in and perhaps even set him on a path to reform.\n\nSo the uncle gave him twenty silver dollars, advising him to marry a good wife and lead a proper life, and above all, to steer clear of opium. He even planned to visit the Hu family in a few days to meet his new niece-in-law.\n\nEver the schemer, Hu Guohua sought to hoodwink his uncle. Upon returning home, he sought out a craftsman skilled in making paper effigies\u2014those burned as offerings for the deceased. This master of paper art could create anything one could imagine, crafting it with such exquisite detail that it appeared almost lifelike.\n\n He did as requested and crafted a paper woman out of white paste paper for Hu Guohua, then painted eyebrows, eyes, a nose, clothes, and hair on the paper figure with watercolors. From a distance, it looked just like a living person.\n\nHu Guohua brought the paper figure home, placed it on the kang in the inner room, and covered it with a quilt. He was quite pleased with himself, thinking that when his uncle visited in a few days, he could simply say his wife was ill, bedridden and unable to receive guests. He imagined his uncle would be content with a brief glimpse from afar. Delighted with his plan, he couldn't help but hum a little tune as he slipped off to the city to smoke opium.\n\nA few days later, his uncle arrived, bringing floral fabrics and pastries to see his nephew's wife. Hu Guohua stuck to his rehearsed script, saying his wife was unwell and couldn't see visitors, allowing his uncle to peek behind the door curtain before quickly dropping it back down.\n\nThe uncle was not pleased. \"You think you can fob off your own uncle like this? No, I must see the new bride today. If she's sick, I'll pay for a doctor to treat her.\"\n\nHu Guohua adamantly refused to let him see her, which only made his behavior seem more suspicious, intensifying his uncle's doubts. As they argued, the curtain to the inner room was suddenly drawn back, and out stepped a woman, fair and clean, with a broad, round face. Hu Guohua's heart skipped a beat. \"Good heavens, isn't that the paper figure I had made? How did it come to life?\"\n\nThe woman greeted the uncle with a bow, apologizing for not having come out to meet him earlier due to her poor health, and asked for forgiveness. She then remarked that she suddenly felt much better and insisted on hosting the uncle for a simple meal. With that, she turned and went to prepare the food.\n\nHu Guohua's uncle was overjoyed, thinking how virtuous and fortunate-looking his nephew's wife was. \"My departed sister, if you knew from the afterlife that your son had married such a fine woman, you'd be thrilled,\" he thought. In his happiness, he handed Hu Guohua ten silver dollars.\n\nHu Guohua stood frozen, his mind in turmoil, uncertain whether to feel lucky or frightened. Time flew by, and evening came. The white paper figure had prepared a table full of dishes, delighting the uncle so much that he couldn't stop smiling. Yet Hu Guohua had no appetite; looking at the woman sitting across from him, he felt a revulsion as if he had swallowed a fly. Her face was pale, devoid of any natural color, with rouge applied to give it a semblance of health.\n\nThe uncle, with his failing eyesight, noticed nothing amiss about the woman. After several cups of strong liquor, he was thoroughly drunk. Hu Guohua then borrowed a donkey cart and sent him home.\n\nOn the way back, Hu Guohua grew increasingly fearful and decided not to return home, instead spending the night in the city's red-light district. There, he squandered the ten silver dollars his uncle had given him on opium and prostitutes.\n\nEventually, he was thrown out for lack of payment and, with nowhere else to go, he reluctantly headed home. When he arrived, he found the house dark, the white paper figure motionless, lying on his bed under a quilt, as if nothing had ever happened.\n\n Hu Guohua contemplated keeping her as a living person for the evening, but then thought it better to rid himself of the potential trouble with a swift blaze. He carried the white paper figure out into the courtyard, fetched his flint and fire, and was about to set the paper figure alight when suddenly it began to speak, \"You heartless wretch, I've been nothing but kind to you, and now you want to burn me?\"\n\nHu Guohua recoiled in shock, his heart pounding in the dead of night as the paper woman continued, \"I took pity on you. Though you indulge in food, drink, and vice, your heart is not entirely corrupt. I wish to marry you. Would you have me?\"\n\nDesperately shaking his head, Hu Guohua asked the paper figure if it was a demon or a ghost. The white paper figure replied, \"I am indeed a ghost, temporarily residing in this paper figure. But don't you look down on me, you poor wretch. In life, I was wealthy, and the gold and silver ornaments among my burial objects are enough for you to smoke opium for ten lifetimes. Have you not heard? A wealthy ghost is a hundred times better than a destitute soul.\"\n\nThe mention of money stirred something in Hu Guohua, especially since he had recently fallen on such hard times that he had pawned all his clothes. However, he had no desire to gain wealth only to die before enjoying it. He had heard old folks tell of female ghosts who ensnared men, draining them of their yang energy until all that was left was a dry skin-wrapped skeleton. So he said to the paper figure, \"Even if your feelings for me are genuine, I cannot marry you. After all, there is a great divide between the living and the dead, the separation of yin and yang. To do otherwise would be against the natural order.\"\n\nThe white paper figure replied, \"If that is how hard your heart is, I won't force you. But a day will come when you will regret this decision. Remember, if you ever become so destitute that you can't go on, seek me out at the desolate graves of Thirteen Li Shops. In the midst of that graveyard, there is a solitary grave without a headstone. Inside lies my coffin, and within it, there is plenty of gold. If you dare to come, take the wealth and spend it as you please.\"\n\nWith that, the white paper figure fell silent and motionless. Hu Guohua, mustering all his courage, lit a fire and reduced the white paper figure to ashes.\n\nLater, when he was so impoverished that he had no other choice, he thought of digging up the grave at Thirteen Li Shops, but each time he refrained, scraping by through borrowing and scrounging. Two years later, when he was utterly destitute and at his wits' end, he finally went to that graveyard\u2014but that is a story for another time."

                    "name": "Chapter 2: Rat Friends",
                    "content": "This Spring Festival season was rife with incidents, and the deception of Hu Guohua's uncle through the crafting of a paper figure for money was finally exposed. His uncle, enraged and overwhelmed, fell ill and within three days, departed this world.\n\nRelatives and friends of the Hu family guarded themselves against him as if he were a thief; not only did they refuse to lend him money, but they wouldn't even spare him leftover scraps of food. Driven to desperation, Hu Guohua sold the last pair of sandalwood chests in his home for two silver dollars. These chests, part of his mother's dowry, were treasured memories he had been reluctant to pawn. But his nicotine addiction was relentless, and he could no longer afford sentimentality. With the two dollars, he purchased a small piece of opium and hurried home, where he eagerly lit his pipe and collapsed onto the bed. After a couple of deep inhales, his body felt as light as if he were floating on clouds.\n\nIn that moment, he felt as blissful as an immortal, free from the disdain, insults, and bullying that plagued his daily life. After another couple of puffs, he suddenly noticed a dark shape on his tattered bed. Squinting, he saw a large rat, old enough to have white whiskers and nearly the size of a cat, inhaling the smoke drifting from Hu Guohua's opium pipe as if it too understood the allure of opium, greedily savoring the fumes.\n\nHu Guohua found this amusing and spoke to the rat, \"You too have a craving for nicotine, it seems we are kindred spirits.\" After taking another puff, he blew smoke rings towards the rat which, sensing no harm from him, raised its head to receive the offered haze. After a while, having had its fill, the rat slowly crawled away.\n\nFor several days, this rat kept Hu Guohua company in his smoking ritual. Shunned by everyone and friendless, Hu Guohua felt a strange kinship with the creature and would sometimes wait for it, enduring his nicotine cravings.\n\nBut the good times were short-lived. The Hu family's possessions dwindled to a mere bed and four walls, and there was no money left for tobacco. Distraught and without a plan, he sighed to the rat, \"Oh rat, my pockets are empty, and I can no longer afford opium. I fear we can't continue to indulge in this pleasure.\" His voice trailed off in lament.\n\nThe rat, upon hearing his words, looked thoughtful, its eyes shining with intelligence. It then turned and left. At dusk, it returned, placing a silver dollar beside Hu Guohua's pillow. Overjoyed, Hu Guohua rushed into town that very night and purchased a piece of opium. He returned home, lit the pipe under the lamp, and, along with the rat, indulged in a satisfying session of smoking.\n\nThe following day, the rat brought three more silver dollars, leaving Hu Guohua so elated he scarcely knew what to say. Recalling an anecdote from his private school days, he said to the rat, \"He who knew Guan Zhong was Bao Shuya. You know of my poverty and have generously bestowed upon me, truly you are my confidant. If you do not disdain it, let us become Sworn Brothers of the Golden Orchid.\" Henceforth, he called the rat 'Brother Rat,' sharing food and opium with it, even arranging a cotton nest on the bed so that the rat could sleep beside him.\n\n Living in harmony with a rat was no less remarkable than having a sworn friend. Every day, the rat would bring back silver coins, sometimes one or two, other times three to five. From then on, Hu Guohua's worries about food and clothing were over. Years later, when my grandfather reminisced, he would always say those days were the happiest of his life.\n\nHalf a year passed in this way, and Hu Guohua gradually prospered. But as the saying goes, wealth finds friends, and misfortune finds foes. It seemed Hu Guohua was fated to be poor, and soon enough, a villain set his sights on him.\n\nThere was a rogue in the village named Wang Ergang, who was unlike Hu Guohua. Hu Guohua had at least known wealth, having been called Young Master Hu for over twenty years.\n\nWang Ergang, on the other hand, wasn't so fortunate. From his ancestors down to his own generation, none had ever worn trousers that didn't expose their rear. He gloated over the downfall of the Hu family, and whenever he could, he would insult and bully Hu Guohua, tormenting the former Young Master Hu for his own sense of balance.\n\nLately, he found it strange that Hu Guohua, who had no visible means of income and whose family had pawned everything of value, could still afford to smoke opium daily. His relatives were nearly all gone, so where was the money coming from? Perhaps this lad had turned to thievery. Wang Ergang thought it might be profitable to secretly watch him and catch him in the act, then turn him over to the authorities for a few silver dollars in reward.\n\nBut after keeping watch for some time, Wang Ergang saw that Hu Guohua rarely left his home, except to buy food and opium in town. He never socialized with anyone. The less Wang Ergang knew about the source of the money, the more it itched at his curiosity.\n\nOne day, while Hu Guohua was out buying groceries, Wang Ergang took the opportunity to climb over the wall into his house. He rummaged through Hu Guohua's belongings, looking for any secret. Suddenly, he spotted a large rat asleep on the bed. Without a second thought, Wang Ergang grabbed the rat and threw it into a pot of boiling water on the stove, then clamped the lid down, thinking to himself that he would enjoy watching Hu Guohua's reaction when he returned home to drink the water.\n\nWang Ergang hadn't even left the house when Hu Guohua returned, catching him red-handed. Seeing the rat in the pot, boiled alive, Hu Guohua's eyes blazed with fury. He grabbed a kitchen knife and began to hack at Wang Ergang, who was struck multiple times. Fortunately for Wang Ergang, Hu Guohua was weakened by opium, so the blows weren't fatal. Bleeding profusely, Wang Ergang managed to escape to the local Security Team for help. The captain of the Security Team was a relative of a local warlord and was entertaining him at that moment. Outraged that such a brazen attack had happened in broad daylight, the captain quickly ordered his men to seize Hu Guohua, who was bound tightly and brought in.\n\n Hu Guohua was brought before the court, where the head of the security team demanded loudly why he had attempted to murder Wang Ergang with a knife. \n\nTears streaming down his face, Hu Guohua sobbed as he recounted the events that had led up to the incident, concluding with a lament: \"Thinking back on how I was once on the brink of death from hardship, had it not been for that old rat, I wouldn't have survived to this day. Yet, due to a moment of negligence, I inadvertently caused the death of Brother Rat. Although I was not the one who killed it, its death was because of me. How can I bear the weight of this loyal friend's demise in the netherworld? I am prepared to face the consequences alone for injuring Wang Ergang. Whatever punishment or execution awaits me, I accept it. All I ask is that you allow me to return home to bury my Brother Rat, so that even in death, I may rest in peace.\"\n\nBefore the head of the security team could respond, a warlord standing nearby, moved by Hu's words, addressed him: \"To forget kindness is inhuman, but to remain true to one's heart is righteous. If you can show such loyalty to a rat, how much more to your fellow man? I admire your sense of righteousness and see that you are alone in this world. From now on, follow me and serve as my aide-de-camp.\"\n\nIn times of chaos, the one who commands the troops makes the law, and the barrel of a gun is the source of power. The Warlord Leader ordered his men to whip Wang Ergang as a way to vent Hu Guohua's anger and then released Hu to go home and bury the rat. Hu Guohua placed the rat's body in a wooden box, dug a hole, buried it, and wept for a long time before he went to join the Warlord Leader.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"When starving, chaff tastes as sweet as honey; when full, even honey loses its sweetness.\" When someone is in dire straits, they are grateful even for a bowl of porridge or a piece of bread from another, let alone the wealth that the rat brought to Hu Guohua. Of course, the rat's money was stolen. The sage says not to drink water stolen from another, but that is the moral standard of the most virtuous and wise, which even the ancients found difficult to meet, let alone an ordinary man like Hu Guohua. It is said that if one smokes in a room over a long period, even the flies and rats within will become addicted; this is no empty claim."

                    "name": "Chapter 3: The Ominous Corpse of the Desolate Grave",
                    "content": "Since then, Hu Guohua had enlisted as a soldier and was greatly favored for his service. However, in that era of chaos, with warlords clashing and the land in turmoil, a mere hundred men could carve out a territory. Today you vanquish me, tomorrow another conquers you; few forces managed to endure. The warlord influence that Hu Guohua followed was minor to begin with, and within a year, it was shattered in the struggle for territory by another faction. The troops were either killed or scattered, and the warlord leader who had promoted Hu Guohua met his end in the fray, a bullet taking his life.\n\nAfter the military defeat, Hu Guohua fled back to his hometown, only to find his family's dilapidated house had collapsed. Having left in haste, he carried no money and had not eaten for two days. His nicotine addiction flared up, and with no other options, he sold his pistol to bandits in exchange for some tobacco and food to address his immediate needs.\n\nHe pondered his situation, realizing this was no way to live. The meager supply of food and opium would last but three to five days at most. What was he to do once it was all consumed? It was then he recalled the words of the wraith attached to the paper effigy of a woman. She had told him, when he could no longer scrape by, to seek out a solitary grave without a tombstone in the Thirteen Li Shops' desolate cemetery, where her burial objects of gold and silver ornaments lay.\n\nNow, Hu Guohua, having been a soldier and seen battle, had a courage far greater than before. He had heard many tales of tomb raiding from a veteran slicker in the army. Tomb raiding, also known as grave robbing among the common folk, could bring sudden wealth but cost one's head if caught. Thus, he dared not act in broad daylight. Steeling his heart, on a night with a faint moon, he lit a lantern and, carrying an iron shovel, made his way to the Thirteen Li Shop Cemetery.\n\nFor those curious, a 'furry moon' refers to a cloudless sky where the moonlight is dim and hazy. Modern folks know this as a 'halo' around the moon, a meteorological phenomenon signaling a change in weather, likely a coming windstorm. But in the rural areas of that time, who could comprehend such scientific explanations? The country folk called it a 'furry moon' and believed that on such nights, lonely spirits and night ghosts were most prone to wander.\n\nUpon arrival, Hu Guohua fortified himself with half a jin of burning liquor to embolden his spirit. The night air was cold as ice, stars twinkling in the frigid sky while a mournful wind whistled through the graves. Phosphorescent fires drifted among the tomb mounds, and the occasional strange bird cried out, its eerie call piercing the silence. The flame in his hand flickered, threatening to extinguish at any moment.\n\nThough he had just drunk, the ghostly atmosphere of the place sent shivers down his spine, and he broke out in a cold sweat, effectively wasting the fiery liquor that now seeped out through his pores.\n\nFortunately, this was a wild graveyard, ancient and unknown, with no human habitation nearby. He could shout as loud as he wished without fear of being heard. Hu Guohua sang a few mountain songs to bolster his courage, but knowing few lyrics, he quickly ran out of words and resorted to humming the familiar Tune of Longing at the Fifth Watch, a melody he knew by heart.\n\nWith trepidation, Hu Guohua made his way to the center of the graveyard, where indeed there stood a solitary grave without a tombstone, its uniqueness setting it apart in the desolate cemetery.\n\nThe grave, lacking a tombstone, held another peculiarity: the coffin was not buried beneath a mound of earth but stood upright, half-exposed on the grave mound. The coffin was new, its eighteen layers of vermillion lacquer gleaming. Under the waning moonlight, it cast a sinister glow.\n\n Hu Guohua harbored some misgivings in his heart, finding the placement of the coffin peculiarly unsettling\u2014as if it harbored some secret significance. Yet, having come all this way, to leave without investigating would render the journey a fruitless endeavor. Starvation from lack of money to buy food was one form of death; dying from nicotine withdrawal due to an opium addiction was another. Either way, it seemed more agreeable to be strangled by a ghost than to endure such agonizing ends. Resigned to his lot in life, which had been nothing but a series of humiliations, he decided to throw caution to the wind and walk this dark path to its end.\n\nWith his mind made up, Hu Guohua hefted his iron shovel and began to dig away the earth sealing the lower half of the coffin. His strength, sapped by his opium addiction, faltered after shifting just a bit of soil, leaving him gasping for breath. He did not rush to open the coffin; instead, he sat on the ground and took a pinch of Fu Rong Ointment, snuffing it up his nose.\n\nStimulated by the opium, his nerves tingled with heightened alertness. Gritting his teeth, he stood up and pried open the coffin lid with his shovel. To his astonishment, the corpse inside was that of a beautiful woman, her features lifelike, though her face was heavily powdered. Her cheeks were daubed with rouge, standing out starkly against the white foundation like two patches of Red Ointment. Adorned with a phoenix crown and a cloud-patterned robe, she was dressed in the auspicious red silk of a bride.\n\nThis was certainly not the Woman with a Big Round Face he had seen two years prior. Moreover, the Paper Figure had instructed him to dig up the grave two years ago. Even if the corpse had been freshly buried at that time, it should have decomposed by now. Could she have become a zombie?\n\nBy this time, however, Hu Guohua could hardly concern himself with such thoughts. His eyes were fixed on the jewelry adorning the corpse, the gold and silver gems twinkling seductively in the lamplight, and the burial objects wrapped in red paper next to her\u2014cylinders of silver dollars and numerous gold bars, too many to count.\n\nHe had stumbled upon a fortune. Eagerly, Hu Guohua reached for the emerald ring on the corpse's hand. But just as he extended his arm, the woman's corpse suddenly flipped her wrist and seized his, her grip unnaturally strong. Her steel-hook-like long fingernails, over an inch long, dug into the flesh of his wrist, rendering him unable to break free. Pain shot through Hu Guohua, a mix of agony and fear, leaving him clueless as to his next move.\n\nThe corpse opened her eyes, emitting a chilling, sinister light that struck Hu Guohua, freezing him to the core as if he had fallen into an ice cave, his breath visible in the cold air.\n\nWith a cold sneer, the corpse spoke, \"You truly are blinded by greed. For money, there's no low you wouldn't stoop to. A heart and liver like yours are useless to you; I might as well take them for myself.\"\n\nUpon hearing her intent for his heart, Hu Guohua panicked, protesting, \"No, no, that cannot be!\" But the corpse did not allow him to speak further. She tore open his clothes and with a slash of her long nails, a fresh, beating heart burst forth from Hu Guohua's chest. The corpse snatched it up and swallowed it whole, blood and all, without even a chew.\n\nHu Guohua was shocked beyond measure. Looking down, he saw a scar on his chest but felt no pain\u2014only a growing haziness in his mind, an emptiness in his heart, unable to recall what had just transpired. He prostrated himself before the corpse, kowtowing repeatedly.\n\nThe corpse, perched atop the upright coffin, addressed Hu Guohua coldly, \"You are now my puppet. I won't mistreat you. I will grant you wealth and honor. In return, you will lure sixty-four women to this graveyard for me to consume their hearts and livers. Should you make any mistake, your life will be the first I take.\"\n\n At that moment, Hu Guohua dared not disobey her command. The book spoke for itself: the female corpse was, in fact, a centuries-old Corpse Demon. To evade her destined calamity, she could not leave the Hiding Cemetery for the time being. She had cunningly lured avaricious grave robbers like Hu Guohua to desecrate the graves, then through threats and temptations, compelled him to capture innocent women to feed her a living heart. Once she consumed the hearts and livers of sixty-four women, she would become invincible, even to the gods descending from the heavens.\n\nHu Guohua scurried away from the Thirteen Li Shops burial ground, his pants soiled in fright. Upon returning, he first stole a pair of trousers from a neighbor's clothesline to change into. He was in a bind now; without even a wife of his own, where could he find a woman for this demon? He also sensed that something vitally important had been taken from him by the creature, but he couldn't recall what it was\u2014only that it was extremely important. Without a woman to offer, his life was on the line. What was he to do?\n\nHis mind raced with frantic thoughts, but then, feeling the two hefty gold bars in the pocket of the foul trousers he had just removed\u2014gifts from the Mistress Female Corpse\u2014he furrowed his brow and hatched a despicable plan to save his own skin. The word 'conscience' felt strange to him, but he couldn't afford to think too much about it. Survival was paramount, even if it meant being unscrupulous.\n\nThe next morning, he exchanged the gold bars for Silver Dollars in the county town, indulged himself in an Opium Den, and then, with ten Silver Dollars, he bought a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl from a poverty-stricken village. In the early years of the Republic of China, despite the official ban on human trafficking, the desperate poverty of the common people made the sale of sons and daughters a common occurrence, and the law was effectively a dead letter.\n\nHaving purchased the young girl, Hu Guohua assured her on the way that he had bought her to be his wife, that she need not worry, and that they would live well together. The girl, named Little Cui, was a shy country lass, her cheeks blushing without daring to look up at him, silently letting him lead the way. Hu Guohua led a small donkey, carrying Little Cui on its back, and under the cover of a moonless and windy night, they headed straight for the desolate graves of the Thirteen Li Shops.\n\nThe mountain path was rugged and difficult, and Hu Guohua, anxious not to miss the appointed time, hurried along the way. He encountered a Feng Shui Master named Mr. Sun, a renowned exorcist throughout the province with the innate ability to see yin and yang, who was adept at the Escape Technique of Five Elements.\n\nUpon seeing Hu Guohua, Mr. Sun noticed a faint black aura enveloping him. After a quick calculation, he was taken aback and urgently stopped Hu Guohua, asking, \"Sir, where are you hastening to in such a rush?\"\n\nImpatiently, Hu Guohua retorted, \"I have urgent matters to attend to; don't block my path.\" Mr. Sun, raising his voice, demanded, \"I have but one question for you, walking corpse: where is your heart and liver?\"\n\nAt these words, Hu Guohua felt as if struck by a thunderbolt and immediately knelt, begging Mr. Sun to save his life.\n\nMr. Sun helped him up, \"Though you lack virtue, you haven't committed unforgivable sins. It's not difficult for me to save you, but you must take me as your master and renounce your nicotine addiction.\"\n\n Hu Guohua listened as he was told to give up opium, a task he felt might as well claim his life. Yet, upon reflection, he concluded that life was more precious than the narcotic soil. \"Where there's life, there's hope,\" he reasoned. \"First, I'll plead with him to save me from the entanglement of that female corpse. Later, when he least expects it, I'll continue to indulge in my Fu Rong Ointment,\" he plotted with determination. On the mountain path, he kowtowed eight times to Mr. Sun, performing the ritual to acknowledge him as his master.\n\nMr. Sun then took charge of the arrangements, instructing Hu Guohua to follow the plan while he discreetly followed behind to protect him.\n\nWhen the moon reached its zenith, Hu Guohua, accompanied by Little Cui, hurried to the desolate gravesite at Thirteen Li Shops. The female corpse had been waiting for some time, and upon their arrival, she scolded Hu Guohua before eagerly seizing Little Cui. She extended her sharp claws to extract the girl's heart and liver and swallowed them whole. Suddenly, the corpse let out a strange cry and tore Little Cui's body to shreds. At that moment, Little Cui revealed her true form; she was actually a paper effigy, a decoy created by Mr. Sun who had already secured the real Little Cui elsewhere.\n\nThe heart that the female corpse had consumed belonged to a black donkey's hoof hidden inside the paper effigy\u2014a substance notorious for warding off evil, particularly effective against zombies and other tomb-raiding spirits. Tomb raiders in the Jiangnan region would carry two black donkey hooves on their person, a practice derived from the secret techniques of Maoshan. The reasons behind this would be explained another time; for now, they remain untold. After ingesting the black donkey's hoof, the demon head realized she had been tricked. Enraged, she attempted to tear Hu Guohua to pieces, but he had already kept his distance. She howled to the sky as her clothes disintegrated into ash, her body turning into a pool of blood. Before long, all that remained was a stark white skeleton on the ground.\n\nMr. Sun, watching from afar, rushed over and extracted a chicken egg-sized Crimson Elixir Pill from the skeleton, instructing Hu Guohua to swallow it. Hu Guohua's heart and liver were thus restored to their rightful place.\n\nTogether, they gathered the bones and placed them into the Big Red Coffin. As they were about to seal the coffin, the skull suddenly leapt up, opening its jaws to spew a cloud of black mist at Mr. Sun. Caught off guard, Mr. Sun was enveloped by the chilling corpse qi, feeling a surge of discomfort in his chest. Nevertheless, his extensive experience in perilous situations kept him from panicking. He quickly shut the coffin lid, secured it firmly with long nails, and then drew intersecting ink lines across the coffin with an Ink Compass. The lines formed a grid-like Black Big Net, sealing the coffin tightly and securely.\n\n Mr. Sun had been severely injured by the malevolent energy of a zombie, and after the flurry of activity, he found himself unable to move, sitting helplessly on the ground. He instructed Hu Guohua to gather some dry wood and set the large vermilion lacquered coffin ablaze. Hu Guohua did as told, lighting a fire that consumed the coffin with voracious flames, sending plumes of black smoke into the air, a stench unbearable. Eventually, all that remained were ashes.\n\nIt was only then that Hu Guohua remembered the gold that had been inside the coffin. He stamped his feet in regret, but it was too late. He had no choice but to support his master, Mr. Sun, and with Little Cui in tow, they went to live in Mr. Sun's household.\n\nMr. Sun later cured Hu Guohua of his nicotine addiction using a secret remedy and taught him some basic skills in Feng Shui and fortune-telling. Hu Guohua set up a small stall in the county town, reading fortunes and faces for passersby to earn a modest income. He married Little Cui, grateful for his master's life-saving grace, and settled into a contented life that gradually improved day by day.\n\nHowever, Mr. Sun never fully recovered from the chilling corpse poison that had penetrated his bones after being sprayed with corpse qi. A few years later, he passed away.\n\nOn his deathbed, Mr. Sun summoned Hu Guohua and said, \"We have shared a bond as master and disciple, but I regret not having the chance to teach you my true skills. Here is an ancient text, the 'Sixteen-Character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Secret Technique.' It's an incomplete volume, only half of the original, with minor techniques for Feng Shui and tomb seeking. Keep it as a memento.\" With those final words, Mr. Sun breathed his last.\n\nHu Guohua buried his master and, in his spare time, studied the fragmented text left to him. Over time, he gleaned subtle insights and began to gain a reputation in the county for selecting auspicious burial sites for the wealthy, which slowly brought prosperity to his household.\n\nLittle Cui bore Hu Guohua a son, whom they named Hu Yunxuan. At seventeen, Hu Yunxuan went to study at the British Church School in the provincial capital. The young man, lively and unrestrained, was also influenced by revolutionary ideas, his blood boiling with fervor. He dreamt nightly of joining revolutionary uprisings and eventually left home to join the revolution in Yan'an, the sacred land of the movement.\n\nHu Yunxuan joined the military and by the time of the founding of the new nation, during the Huai River Campaign, he had risen to the rank of a certain regiment commander in the Three Wild Six Vertical formation. After the Crossing the River Campaign, he moved south with his unit and settled in the south.\n\nLater on, I was born, coincidentally on August 1st Army Day, and my father named me Hu Jianjun. However, when I started kindergarten, there were seven or eight other children with the same name, so to avoid confusion, my name was changed to Hu Bayi.\n\n My grandfather, Hu Guohua, once remarked, \"This name has been well-chosen, simple and yet encompassing everything.\"\n\nWhen I turned eighteen, my family faced turmoil. It began with the downfall of the leaders among the Three Wilderness Officers, and gradually others were implicated. My parents, due to their less favorable backgrounds, were both isolated for investigation. My grandfather was dragged out for a public denouncement parade as an 'Evil Being.' Being advanced in years, his frail limbs couldn't endure the harsh treatment, and he passed away after only a couple of struggles. He spent his life consulting on Feng Shui and selecting burial sites for others, yet in the end, he himself was cremated\u2014a testament to life's unpredictability.\n\nOur home was raided three times, with all valuables confiscated. My grandfather had a penchant for collecting antiques; these were either smashed or seized, not a single one was spared. The sole survivor was a damaged book he left behind, which I managed to preserve by wrapping it in oilcloth and hiding it above the public toilet's ceiling.\n\nUpon graduation during the Cultural Revolution, young people had three choices: enlist in the military, which was the most favorable option as it not only tempered one's character but also promised job placement upon reassignment. The second option was to stay in the city and work as a laborer, which was also decent due to the wages earned. The most unfortunate were those without connections or those whose families had been affected by the political turmoil; these youths had no choice but to 'go up to the mountains and down to the countryside' to join the rural workforce.\n\nYou might wonder if I considered a fourth option\u2014to simply stay at home. But that wasn't feasible, as there was no such thing as an 'idle person' back then. Everyone was a 'Socialist Screw,' serving a purpose. If you stayed at home, the Neighborhood Committee and the Educated Youth Office would hound you daily to mobilize. However, some persisted and ultimately avoided the countryside labor, managing to stay in the city and eventually being allocated work. Such is the nature of things in China\u2014ambiguous and perplexing, with rules that are never clear and unwritten norms not everyone comprehends.\n\nI was too young at the time to fully understand what 'going up to the mountains and down to the countryside' entailed. With my family background, joining the military was out of the question, and no one would arrange a city job for me. With nowhere else to go, I figured I might as well embrace the countryside labor. I thought of it as an opportunity to cultivate a 'Red Heart' in the vast world, reasoning that if I was to leave home, I might as well go as far as possible.\n\nMost people from our area chose to go to Yunnan or Xinjiang, but I opted for Inner Mongolia. A buddy of mine, Wang Kaixuan, who was paler and plumper than most, earning him the nickname 'Fatty,' decided to join me. We were assigned to a place called Ganggang Camp, a name I had never even heard before until the moment they told me that was my destination. It was then I realized such a place existed in the world.\n\nLeaving home by train, no one came to see us off. In stark contrast to the warm farewells given to those joining the military, our departure as Educated Youths was a scene of desolation and solemnity. I took with me only the Sixteen-Character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Secret Technique, the book I had hidden in the public toilet's ceiling. I didn't know the content of the book, but it was the only thing left from my family. I wanted to keep it close, so I could look at it whenever homesickness struck."

                    "name": "Chapter 4: The Ancient Tomb in the Mountains",
                    "content": "Though it's called Inner Mongolia, it's actually not far from Heilongjiang, nearly reaching the border of Outer Mongolia. The residents are predominantly Han, with only a minority of Manchu and Mongolian ethnicities. If you've never been to Ganggang Camp, you could never imagine how tough it is out there. Our group of Educated Youth totaled six people, four men and two women. Upon arrival, we were stunned: all around us were rolling mountains and endless primitive forests. Once you left the village, you could walk a hundred miles without seeing a soul.\n\nThere were no roads, let alone electricity. Even having an oil lamp was considered a privilege reserved for cadres, and using a flashlight was like staying in a Presidential Suite by today's standards. In the city, one could never fathom this; we had thought the entire nation was filled with buildings, bright lights, and telephones.\n\nYet, there was a sense of novelty at that time. I had never seen such large mountains, and many of the local mountain delicacies were new to my palate. The nearby mountains were rich in resources, and the rivers were teeming with fish, so we never worried about going hungry. Later, when we returned to the city, we heard from those who had been sent to work in Shaanxi how truly hard their lives were; for years they hadn't seen a single decent grain of food.\n\nThe work for Educated Youth wasn't too burdensome since the area relied on the mountains for sustenance, and there wasn't much in the way of crops. On summer evenings, we took turns guarding the crops in the fields for fear of wild animals nibbling them away, which meant spending nights out in the fields.\n\nThe crops in the mountains weren't like the vast expanse of green seen on the North China Plain, but rather patchworks here and there\u2014wherever the land was flat, a field was made. So, one had to regularly patrol at night. That night, it was my turn to pair up with Fatty. Fatty slept in the thatched hut while I went out for a round. Seeing nothing amiss, I decided to head back to sleep.\n\nApproaching the hut, I saw a large, round, white shadow not far from it. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. It wasn't a figment of my imagination, but it was too dark to make out exactly what it was. I didn't believe in ghosts and thought it might be an animal, so I picked up a stick, hoping to drive it away.\n\nA white, shimmering object in the pitch dark, swaying slightly\u2014this surely didn't look like any animal, but if it wasn't an animal, why would it move? The darkness was too thick, and without a kerosene lamp, I couldn't discern its nature.\n\nAlthough I wasn't afraid of ghosts and goblins, the fear of the unknown still lurked within me. I didn't dare to swing the stick wildly. The stick in my hand was just a rough branch I had picked up from the ground. I gently prodded the white mass with the branch; it was soft. Suddenly, out of the darkness, I heard Fatty yelling, \"Hu Bayi, why the hell are you poking me with a stick?\"\n\nIt was a false alarm. It turned out Fatty had eaten some unclean fruit during the day, and his stomach was upset. He squatted there to relieve himself, and in the darkness, his white backside was all too conspicuous.\n\n The following morning, Fatty was relentless in demanding compensation from me, claiming that the previous night's scare had killed off over a million of his brain cells. I retorted, \"With a brain like yours, do you really think you had that many to begin with? We're both destitute bachelors here, having heeded the highest directive to come to the countryside for the much-needed re-education amongst the lower-middle peasants. What exactly do you expect me to compensate you with? Let me make it clear, as your close comrade-in-arms, all I have left to my name is these trousers I'm wearing\u2014and they're my last pair. You surely don't expect me to give you these as compensation?\"\n\nFatty, with a mischievous grin, said that wouldn't be necessary. \"Yesterday, at Tuan Mountain, in that old forest, I came across a massive beehive. If you help me poke it, we can get some honey to mix with water for a drink. We could even barter the honey for rabbit meat with Yanzi's father.\"\n\nYanzi was a girl's name; her father was a well-known old hunter in the village. Fatty and I were staying at the Educated Youth Point in her home. The father-daughter duo often went hunting in the mountains, occasionally inviting us to savor some game. We always felt a little guilty for partaking in their generosity without being able to reciprocate, but we were too poor to offer anything in return.\n\nDiscovering a large beehive, we decided to gather some honey as a gift for Yanzi. Both of us, known for our impulsive nature, were infamous in the city as mischievous troublemakers of the entire Military Region. Poking a beehive was child's play for us; we'd done far more daring deeds.\n\nWary of losing our way, I borrowed Yanzi's hunting dog, a young pup she had raised herself but never had the heart to take hunting. She had named him Chestnut Yellow. Seeing that we were headed to Tuan Mountain for fun, she lent us the dog.\n\nTuan Mountain wasn't too far from our village as the crow flies, but with no paths to follow, it took us half a day of trekking over hills and dales to get there. The forest was vast, and villagers had warned us against entering, cautioning that human bears roamed within. We had seen a man in the village with only half a face; as a child, he had encountered a human bear right here. Luckily, Yanzi's father arrived just in time, firing a shot to scare off the creature and saving the boy. However, the bear had already licked his face with its tongue full of backward-facing barbs, tearing away a large patch of flesh. Now in his forties, without an eye, ear, nose, or a straight mouth on the left side of his face, he remained unmarried. The elders would tear up when they spoke of his plight.\n\nThough we were bold, we dared not venture into the primeval forest. The beehive Fatty mentioned was one he'd spotted while gathering pine seeds with the villagers at the forest's edge, hanging on a large tree by a stream.\n\nUnexpectedly, the hive was enormous, larger than any we had ever poked, all combined. From a distance, it resembled a limbless calf hanging from the tree, with a dark swarm of giant bees buzzing in and out, their droning deafening to the ears.\n\n \"Little Fatty, you're setting me up, aren't you? Is this a hornet's nest or a giant Wasp Atomic Bomb? If this thing blows, we're done for,\" I said. Fatty replied confidently, \"If it were just an ordinary nest, would I have bothered you? I'd have taken care of it myself. So, what do you say? Still up for the challenge?\"\n\n\"What are we even worried about? Our team is invincible; we don't even fear the American Imperialism's Airplane Tanks, let alone a few tiny bees. They're all paper tigers. Damn it, we're going to feast on honey today.\"\n\nDespite the bravado, we couldn't just rush in recklessly. A single misstep could result in a swarm of wasps stinging us to death. The sheer size of these bees suggested they were venomous. Just one or two stings could be lethal. Fortunately, there was a small river nearby \u2013 a stroke of divine luck. I took out a piece of bread, broke it in two, and fed Chestnut Yellow, making sure it stayed well away. Then we donned our Military Greatcoats, pulled on fur hats, wound Scarves around our necks, slipped on gloves, and covered our faces with transparent scarves borrowed from female Educated Youths. After ensuring not a sliver of skin was exposed, Fatty found a couple of hollow reeds for us to breathe through when we would have to take refuge in the river from the swarming hornets.\n\nOnce we were ready, we lumbered to the tree like two cumbersome bears, swaying with every step. I held a bundle of Winter Seed Grass and matches at the ready, while Fatty gripped a long pole and counted, \"Three.\" On three, he jabbed the pole at the point where the massive nest was attached to the tree trunk. After four or five stabs, the huge nest fell to the ground with a thud. Countless Giant Hornets immediately buzzed out, forming a dark cloud overhead with a menacing hum.\n\nI was well-prepared. Ignoring the attacking swarm, I struck a match and lit the Winter Seed Grass, placing it downwind of the nest. The smoke disoriented the emerging hornets, causing them to fly about erratically. Fatty and I quickly built a protective Fire Wall with mud around the burning grass to prevent a Mountain Wildfire.\n\nBy then, the hornets that had escaped the smoke had identified their targets and were converging on us. It felt like hailstones were pummeling my head as they struck. Without hesitation, Fatty and I dashed for the nearby stream. The water was shallow, less than a meter deep, but it was enough. We plunged in, the current sweeping away the hornets clinging to us. Clutching my fur hat to keep it from being swept away, I used one of the reeds to breathe.\n\nIt was a long while before we surfaced. By then, the hornets were either drowned or knocked out by the smoke; the danger had passed. Although it was midsummer, the mountain stream was icy cold. I shivered uncontrollably as I finally crawled onto the bank, lying on a rock and gasping for air. The warmth of the sun on my head was indescribably comforting after the ordeal.\n\n Before long, Fatty could no longer hold out and staggered onto the bank. Just as he was halfway up, he suddenly yelped, jerking his arm up to reveal a large gash from which blood was streaming.\n\nI hurried back down into the creek to help him. Clutching his wound, Fatty said, \u201cBe careful, there seems to be a broken bowl in the river that got me.\u201d\n\nThere were no inhabitants nearby, so the presence of a broken bowl piqued my curiosity. Stripping down to my skin, I dove into the creek bare-chested and felt around the area where Fatty was injured. I found half a broken porcelain bowl, its style and bluish-green patterns reminiscent of the Northern Song dynasty blue-and-white porcelain once collected by my grandfather.\n\nMy grandfather's antiques and paintings were all destroyed by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution's campaign to obliterate the \"Four Olds.\" To come across such a relic in this deep mountain, old forest stirred a sense of familiarity within me. Yet, such an object held little use for me, and with a flick of my wrist, I tossed the broken half-bowl far into the woods.\n\nFatty also stripped off his drenched clothes and wrapped up his wound in a makeshift bandage before jumping back into the creek. We bathed ourselves, then laid our clothes and socks out to dry on the creek-side pebbles. I gave a whistle call to summon Chestnut Yellow back.\n\nChestnut Yellow came running back from a distance, a plump gray hare clenched in its jaws. I couldn't fathom how this unlucky creature had ended up caught by Chestnut Yellow, a hunting dog still in training. Overjoyed at the sight of the hare, I rolled around on the ground with Chestnut Yellow, praising the good dog, and rewarded it with a large chunk of honeycomb dripping with honey.\n\nFatty suggested, \"When we get back, we should get a few puppies to raise. Then we can have rabbit meat every day.\"\n\nI replied, \"You're dreaming too sweetly. The mountains can't sustain your voracious appetite. Enough talk; I'm actually quite hungry. Hurry and clean the rabbit, I'll gather wood for a fire.\"\n\nFatty cleaned the rabbit by the creek while I gathered a bundle of dry pine branches and started a campfire. I coated the skinned hare with a thick layer of honey and set it to roast over the flames. Before long, the sweet aroma of honey-roasted rabbit filled the air. I cut off the rabbit head to feed the dog, and Fatty and I heartily devoured the rest, splitting it between us. I had never tasted anything so delicious in my life, almost swallowing my own fingers in the process. Though unseasoned with oil or salt, the wild honey and pine branches lent the rabbit a unique natural flavor, a delicacy unimaginable in city life. The life of an 'Educated Youth' was a mix of hardship and joy; society had pushed us to these remote mountains, and though we had lost some things, we had also gained what could never be found in the city. It seems that in life, some things cannot be measured simply by what is gained or lost.\n\n After a hearty meal and noticing the day was getting late, we saw that our clothes were almost dry. We threaded a large honeycomb with a thick branch and carried it between us, singing revolutionary songs as we returned to the village: \"The sky is vast, the earth is vast, but nothing compares to the resolve in our hearts; father's love, mother's love, none as close as comrade's affection.\" It was just like the triumphant return from battle, with drums beating and people singing in victory. The only discordant note was the excited barking of Chestnut Yellow, which somehow reminded me of the atmosphere in movies when the Ghosts enter a village.\n\nBack in the village, I noticed that many people were absent, so I asked Swallow, \"Where have your father and the others gone?\"\n\nAs Swallow helped us carry the beehive, she answered, \"The Chaganha River has flooded, and the timber at the Forest Farm has been soaked. Most of the villagers went there to help move the wood at noon. The Branch Secretary asked me to tell you to take good care of the crops and not to cause any trouble. They won't be back for about seven or eight days.\"\n\nI never liked it when people told me not to cause trouble, as if I was born a troublemaker. So I said to Swallow, \"The Branch Secretary must have gotten confused by the liquor. What trouble could we possibly cause? We are all good kids here.\"\n\nSwallow laughed and said, \"You don't cause trouble? Ever since you city Educated Youths arrived, the village hens have been so disturbed they've stopped laying eggs.\"\n\nThe other two male Educated Youths had also gone to the Forest Farm, leaving just me, Fatty, and two other female Educated Youths. We felt lucky not to have been assigned to work at the Forest Farm because we had gone out to play. We poured the honey into jars, filling more than ten large earthenware pots. Swallow mentioned that the leftover honeycombs could also be cooked and eaten, promising to make us stir-fried roe deer meat with honeycomb that evening.\n\nAs soon as we mentioned eating, Fatty's eyes lit up. He said, \"Our life today is almost as good as during New Year's. We had roasted rabbit meat this afternoon, and tonight we'll have stir-fried roe deer meat with honeycomb. I'm already drooling.\" Swallow asked us where we had roasted the rabbit. After telling her the story, she exclaimed, \"Oh no, you shouldn't be reckless! Roasting a wild rabbit near the Old Forest could attract a man-eating bear. What would we do then?\"\n\nWe hadn't thought about the danger until she mentioned it, feeling lucky that the bear must have been asleep today and hadn't smelled the roasted meat. As I helped Swallow start the fire, I told her about Fatty cutting his hand on a broken bowl in the stream, wondering how a bowl from the Song Dynasty could end up in such a wild place.\n\nSwallow said it wasn't surprising at all. \"In our village, when a girl gets married, every family has a few jars and pots as part of the dowry, all fished out from the river.\"\n\nThe more I heard, the more curious I became. \"You can fish antiques out of the river?\" Swallow pulled out two porcelain vases from under the bed to show me. \"They don't grow in the river; they've been washed down from upstream. The sources of several rivers near our village are in the Lama Gully at Ox Heart Mountain. The elders say that the mountain is the site of an empress dowager's tomb from the Liao and Jin Dynasties, filled with buried treasures. Many people have wanted to find that tomb, but those who haven't found it either never return from Lama Gully or get lost in its dense forest. My father once saw wild men lurking in the gully, and some say Ox Heart Mountain is haunted. In any case, no one has dared to go there in recent years.\"\n\n As we spoke, night had already fallen. Yanzi had finished preparing the meal, and Fatty went to call the other two female Educated Youths to eat. However, no sooner had he left than he came running back, gasping for breath, with one of them, Wang Juan. I hastily inquired what had happened.\n\nWang Juan took a moment to catch her breath before explaining. It turned out that the other female Educated Youth, Tian Xiaomeng, had received a letter from home informing her that her mother was hospitalized with a severe case of asthma. Having heard that the Bodhisattva Fruit, which grew in Lama Gully, had miraculous effects on asthma, Tian Xiaomeng set out alone to gather it. She had left in the morning and now, with darkness upon us, she had not returned.\n\nA vein throbbed fiercely on my forehead. Tian Xiaomeng had been too reckless; that place was all virgin forest, where even the most experienced hunters from the village dared not venture lightly. How could she have gone there alone?\n\nWang Juan cried, \"I couldn't stop her. We must hurry to find her. What if something terrible has happened?\"\n\nBut at the moment, all the village's labor force had gone to the Forest Farm, leaving only the elderly and the young behind. If we were to seek help, only Fatty and I could go. Yanzi also decided to bring along Chestnut Yellow, the dog, and a hunting rifle. We left Wang Juan behind to watch over the crops in the village.\n\nWith a dog in the mountains, one need not fear getting lost. Without delay, we lit our torches, took Chestnut Yellow, and ventured into the mountains at night. The Deep Mountain Old Forest had no paths to follow, and I couldn't fathom how Tian Xiaomeng, a girl on her own, had dared to penetrate the deepest parts of the great mountain. Fatty suggested she might have been confused in her panic\u2014who wouldn't be anxious with their own mother ill?\n\nBecause it was dark and we needed the dog to track the scent, and since Chestnut Yellow hadn't been professionally trained, we often lost the trail and had to backtrack to find it again. So we moved slowly. A journey that would usually take four or five hours took us the entire night. Dawn broke in the east, and the morning wind in the great forest raised goosebumps on our skin. The crisp air invigorated us. Yanzi pointed to the west: \"Look, that big mountain over there is Ox Heart Mountain.\"\n\n Fatty and I looked westward, where the vast forest sea cloaked the rolling hills. Amidst them towered an oddly shaped colossal peak, resembling the heart of an ox. Nine white jade-like waterfalls cascaded down the mountain, their rushing torrents reminiscent of dragons. The porcelain pieces picked up by the villagers had been washed out from these waterfalls, suggesting that the tomb of the Empress Dowager of the Liao dynasty, spoken of in legends, might indeed lie within the mountain. Yet, for all these years, no one had managed to find its entrance.\n\nThe sight of this magnificent peak suddenly triggered a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu within me. I felt certain I had seen such a mountain before. With a flicker of thought, I recalled a passage from the tattered book left behind by my grandfather that I would peruse in my idle moments. This landscape was a prime example of Fengshui Treasure, with clear prospects in front and reliable support behind. The nine waterfalls divided the hill like a blooming lotus, indeed, it was referred to as Nine Dragons Guarding the Jade Lotus.\n\nThe mountain's nine waterfalls, neither more nor less, and the sheer volume of the flowing water, were essential to the pattern of Nine Dragons Guarding the Jade Lotus. Nine, the largest single-digit number, carries connotations of supremacy and eternity, as it sounds like the word for 'long-lasting' in Chinese. It has always been regarded as the most auspicious number. Moreover, if the waterfalls had a lesser flow, they would not represent dragons, but rather snakes.\n\nThis kind of Fengshui Treasure also bore another name, Luo Goddess's Chariot. According to the book, it was most fitting to bury females in such a place, for if a male were interred there, his family would befall great misfortune.\n\nAt that moment, a vague feeling washed over me. My grandfather's Sixteen-Character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Secret Technique was not mere superstitious nonsense; the contents of the book held genuine substance. I resolved to give it a thorough read upon my return.\n\nHowever, I didn't believe that this Feng Shui practice had any practical value. Throughout China's ancient history, with its myriad emperors and generals, none were buried just anywhere. The rise and fall of dynasties, the great currents of history, surely could not be swayed by the auspiciousness of an ancestral grave.\n\nYanzi pointed towards the valley in front of Ox Heart Mountain and said, \"This is the renowned Lama Gully. Legend has it that Wild Men dwell within, and at night, it's Haunted.\"\n\nFatty glanced at the dense primeval forest that darkened the valley and frowned, \"If Tian Xiaomeng entered Lama Gully, she'd definitely get lost. With just the three of us and a dog, finding her is going to be quite the challenge.\"\n\nSeeing their spirits dampen, I rallied them with encouragement, \"Communist materialists should not believe in the existence of Ghosts. Whether it's Ghosts or Wild Men, if I encounter them, they'll be the unlucky ones. I'll catch a few alive and bring them back to Beijing as a gift. I'm sure the sight will astonish everyone.\"\n\n Fatty and I, both soldiers by family background, had a natural-born fearlessness coursing through our veins. His spirits lifted upon hearing my words, and he readied himself to enter the gully with zeal.\n\nOnly Yanzi was fraught with worry. As a local, she had grown up on countless terrifying tales of Lama Gully, which instilled in her an inherent fear. But with lives at stake, she had no choice but to cast these fears aside.\n\nBefore setting out, the three of us sat down for some dry food and checked our equipment. We had two hunting rifles between us, both belonging to Yanzi and her father for hunting. One was a triple-barreled shotgun, the other a lever-action rifle commonly used by the Oroqen people. Both were outdated, muzzle-loading firearms. They packed a punch at close range but beyond thirty-five meters, their power and precision faltered, suitable only for small game like hares and roe deer.\n\nI had been shooting at ranges with my father since I was six, familiar with the standard-issue weapons of the People's Liberation Army, but I had no confidence in handling these antiquated flintlock hunting rifles. Fatty's experience was similar to mine, so after a brief discussion, Yanzi and I each took a rifle, and Fatty armed himself with a wood-chopping machete. Thus prepared, we plunged into the dense woods of Lama Gully.\n\nIn Lama Gully, more immediate and real than the legendary Wild Man or mountain ghosts, was the threat of the Human Bear. Though a bear like any other, the Human Bear was so named for its bipedal gait. Massive and tough, hunters dared to confront it only in groups, accompanied by packs of hunting dogs. A lone individual with a decrepit gun facing a Human Bear in the primeval forest was tantamount to a death sentence.\n\nWe trekked through the forest for the better part of the day, the thundering sound of the nine great waterfalls of Ox Heart Mountain growing ever louder, signaling the end of Lama Gully and the approach to the base of the mountain.\n\nWithout any encounters with Human Bears or Wild Men, nor any sign of Tian Xiaomeng, Fatty collapsed on the ground, exhausted: \"I can't go on.\"\n\n\"Let's rest for a bit then,\" suggested Yanzi. \"Lizi Huang seems to have lost Tian Xiaomeng's scent too. What do we do if we can't find her? The Branch Secretary and my father will have my hide when they return.\"\n\n Exhausted, I grabbed the water bottle and took several hearty gulps before saying to the two of them, \"Tian Xiaomeng might have been eaten by a Human Bear, or perhaps even taken by a Wild Man to become his bandit bride.\"\n\nAs we rested and chatted idly, suddenly we heard Chestnut Yellow barking furiously towards the depths of the dense forest. Hunting dogs of such fine pedigree would never bark so wildly unless they were in extreme danger.\n\nI asked Swallow, \"What's gotten into the dogs? Is there some wild animal out there?\"\n\nSwallow's face turned ashen. \"Climb a tree, quickly\u2014it's a Human Bear.\"\n\nAt the mention of the Human Bear, I scrambled up a large tree in haste. Looking down, I saw Swallow straining to lift Fatty, who was not adept at climbing and was laboriously hugging the trunk, inching upwards. I swiftly slid back down and, together with Swallow, we helped Fatty up to the lowest large branch, where he lay panting heavily, complaining, \"The tree is too tall.\"\n\nChestnut Yellow's barks grew more frantic, and before Swallow and I could climb back up, a black-furred Human Bear burst through the shrubbery. Spotting a living person, it reared up on its hind legs, roaring thunderously.\n\nSwallow, who had spent years hunting in the mountains with her father and was immensely experienced, didn't have time to think. She raised her hunting rifle and fired at the Human Bear. With a spark and a bang, the bullet struck the bear's belly.\n\nDue to the close range and the softness of the bear's abdomen, the shot tore a large hole, from which blood and entrails poured forth. Wounded and enraged, the Human Bear stuffed its intestines back inside with its massive paws, then charged at Swallow in a fury. Swallow's rifle couldn't fire in rapid succession, and with trees and thorns blocking her retreat, she had no choice but to close her eyes and await death.\n\nSaving her was imperative. Without a second thought, I aimed my gun at the Human Bear's head. If I missed, Swallow would be done for. My hand trembled at the thought, but I gritted my teeth and pulled the trigger. The shotgun's tremendous recoil nearly knocked me to the ground, and whether it was due to the firearm's insufficient lethality or my off-aim, the shot, though hitting the Human Bear's head, only blinded one of its eyes.\n\nWhile not fatal, the shot saved Swallow. The Human Bear, now blind in one eye and with blood covering its face, half an eyeball still dangling from the socket, became even more frenzied. It abandoned Swallow and lunged straight at me.\n\nAt that moment, Chestnut Yellow fiercely bit the Human Bear's hind leg. As the bear turned to grab Chestnut Yellow, the dog, ever so alert, dashed away and provocatively bared its teeth at the Human Bear from a distance.\n\nThis brief respite allowed Swallow and me to seize those precious seconds to each climb a large tree, narrowly escaping the clutches of death.\n\n The Human Bear was grievously wounded, its innards punctured and spilling out, one eye blinded. In the mountains, even tigers gave it a wide berth, but it had never suffered such a loss before. It wanted to snatch up Little Chestnut Yellow, but it couldn't run as fast as the hunting dogs, and when it sought to sink its teeth into the three men, they had all scrambled up into the trees. Circling the base in frustration, it seethed with a bellyful of malevolent fire, yet for the moment, it was at a loss for what to do. Raging like a thunderstorm, it roared up at the sky, its howls reverberating through the valley.\n\nPerched atop a tree, I watched the Human Bear pacing in circles below, its predicament amusing to me as I forgot my own precarious situation. I called out to Fatty, who was on another tree, \"Hey, Fatty, why isn't your dear uncle leaving? What's he doing circling around down there? Advise him not to be so rash.\"\n\nFatty, more scared of heights than the Human Bear, clung to the fork of the tree, trembling with fear. But upon hearing my taunt, he wouldn't let it slide and retorted, \"Hu Bayi, aren't you the heartless one? That's not my uncle down there. Look closely before you speak\u2014that's your wife, isn't it?\"\n\nI burst into laughter and pointed at the Human Bear below, teasing Fatty, \"My mistake, that's actually your dear aunt. I'm certainly not going to be your uncle-in-law.\"\n\nFrustrated and furious, Fatty wanted to hurl pine cones at me, but both his hands were tightly gripping the branch, afraid that letting go would send him plummeting down. He dared not make any sudden movements and could only glare at me helplessly.\n\nSeeing Fatty's state only made me laugh harder, but my mirth froze instantly when I saw the Human Bear, heedless of anything else, beginning to climb the very tree I was in.\n\nClumsy though it was, the bear's strength was tremendous, and its grievous wounds had driven it completely mad. Now, it saw only us three men and one dog. With a bloodshot eye, it dug its massive claws into the tree bark, and its colossal frame ascended over a meter with each lunge. I cursed inwardly, \"Who the hell told me bears can't climb trees? This is a deathtrap!\"\n\nIn the mountains, there's an old hunter's adage for the younger ones: \"Rather face a fierce tiger than a mad bear.\" The completely crazed Human Bear, with its terrifying destructive and explosive power, filled me with dread, leaving no room for jests with Fatty. All I could think of was how to escape this predicament.\n\nThat's when Yanzi reminded me, \"Load it with iron sand, aim for its other eye.\"\n\nOnly then did I remember the hunting shotgun strapped to my back. Cursing my own uselessness, I climbed higher towards the treetop and untied the Armed Belt that was fastening my trousers. I secured the Armed Belt onto a sturdy branch that could bear my weight, held onto the shotgun with one hand to maintain my balance, and with the other hand, I began loading the gun with gunpowder. I poured nearly half a horn's worth of powder into the muzzle.\n\nThe Human Bear was ascending swiftly, drawing ever closer to me. Yanzi and Fatty were both sweating bullets on my behalf. I focused all my attention on the task of loading the shotgun, deliberately ignoring the Human Bear climbing up towards me.\n\n After packing the gunpowder, I pressed in the iron sand, ramming both tightly with a metal rod. Sweat drenched the hollows of my nose and the temples of my forehead. Such a hunting rifle was truly a nuisance, a damned gun that could claim a life. In the vast forests of the Northeast, how many hunters had lost their precious lives for want of a faster gun? If only I had a Type 56 Semi-automatic Rifle at this moment, even if two or three Human Bears came at me, it would be no matter. Under these circumstances, even a mere pistol would have been better.\n\nJust as I finished loading the iron sand and gunpowder, and had replaced the tinder and flint, the Human Bear's paw reached my foot. I quickly withdrew it, flipping the rifle's muzzle downward in a swift motion to aim right at the Human Bear's head and fired. The shot, overloaded with powder, sent up a cloud of smoke, blackening my face with soot.\n\nThe musket worked by propelling the iron sand with the force of the gunpowder, but the low angle had loosened the sand in the barrel, diminishing its intended power. Moreover, shooting one-handed and at close range without any support, the shot went awry, missing its head and merely mangled the Human Bear's shoulder. The beast fell from the tree, a dozen meters up, and crashed heavily to the ground, which was thick with deep layers of dead branches and leaves. Its thick skin and flesh meant the fall from such a height did little harm.\n\nThe Human Bear got up. This time, it didn't climb but charged like a heavy tank, bellowing strangely and slamming its hefty body against the trees, causing pine needles and cones to rain down like droplets.\n\nThankfully, I was secured to the tree with an armed belt, preventing me from being shaken off. I worried that the tree might not be sturdy enough to withstand the Human Bear's onslaught and could snap at the base. It seemed I was destined to die today in the Deep Mountain Old Forest. Facing death, I couldn't lose face. I had to show some revolutionary spirit, let Fatty and Yanzi see that Old Hu was no coward. So I bellowed to my two comrades: \"Looks like I'm about to meet Marx. Sorry, comrades, I'm going ahead to save seats for you. Do you have any messages for the revolutionary mentor? I'll be sure to pass them on.\"\n\nFatty, perched on another large tree some distance away, yelled back: \"Old Hutong Spirit, go in peace. The Revolutionary Cause will not be affected by your absence. When you meet old Marx, study the revolutionary theories well. I hear they always eat potatoes stewed with beef over there; will that suit your palate?\"\n\nI replied: \"When have we revolutionaries ever been picky eaters, Comrade Fatty? Keep pushing the revolutionary cart forward without faltering. The red flag shall overturn the serf's halberd, the tyrant's whip held high. The remaining two-thirds of the suffering masses in the world rely on you for liberation. As for me, I'm off to eat potatoes and stewed beef every day.\"\n\n Swallow, in a fit of panic, burst into tears. \"What are we doing wasting time with idle talk? Think of something, quick!\"\n\nJust when we were at our wits' end, Human Bear stopped ramming its body into the tree and took a breather, sitting on the ground and panting heavily. It turned out that Human Bear had lost a lot of blood and, after all its thrashing about, even a creature of its brute strength had its limits. Now, it had calmed down from its fury, learned its lesson, and decided to wait us out, resting under the tree as we faced off.\n\nChestnut Yellow had also witnessed the ferocity of Human Bear and dared not approach it for another bite, squatting at a distance instead. The dog was hungry, but out of loyalty to its master, it refused to scavenge for food. Swallow, feeling sorry for her dog, whistled for Chestnut Yellow to go find something to eat, and only then did it leave.\n\nThe three of us lay on the tree, deliberating our next move, but after much thought, we found no viable solution. Descending the tree for a direct confrontation, armed only with our old-fashioned muskets, would be tantamount to seeking our own deaths. With most of the villagers absent, we couldn't hope for rescue. To prevent falling from the tree, we each fastened ourselves firmly to the trunk with our belts, resolved to see who would outlast the other.\n\nThis stalemate was most disadvantageous for the three of us perched in the tree. The recent harrowing struggle with Human Bear had drained much of our strength. Evening was fast approaching, and we had been without sleep for two days and a night, having eaten only a few cornmeal pancakes during the day. We were both hungry and sleepy, fearing that by morning we might faint from hunger and fall from the tree.\n\nThe situation reminded me of a line from Chairman Mao's poetry: \"Surrounded by countless enemy troops, I stand firm and unmoved.\" But unlike the poem, there were no banners fluttering below, only Human Bear on guard.\n\nLost in these scattered thoughts, I unknowingly dozed off against the trunk, and after who knows how long, I awoke to an unbearable hunger gnawing at my stomach. I opened my eyes to a sky dense with stars and a crescent moon hanging like a hook, signaling the deep of night. The forest was silent, and by the moonlight, I saw that Human Bear was no longer below. When it had left, I couldn't say. The branches were thick, obscuring my view of whether Swallow and Fatty were still on the tree. I called out loudly, \"Swallow, Fatty, are you still up there?\"\n\nAfter several shouts, my voice echoed through the midnight valley, but there was no response from the two. Though I was usually brave, the thought of being alone in the primeval forest sent a chill down my spine. It seemed inconsiderate of them to have left without waking me.\n\nI called out twice more from the tree, but still, there was no reply. Anxiety set in as I scanned the surroundings and noticed a flickering light not far ahead. It was surprising to find signs of habitation in such a place. Perhaps they had seen the light and gone to seek help?\n\nIn the darkness, I couldn't discern the cardinal directions, but the sound of flowing water was loud and clear. I looked up to locate the North Star and surmised the light must be coming from the direction of Ox Heart Mountain. I slid down from the tree and made my way toward the light, each step alternating between deep and shallow.\n\n I began to fantasize that the master of those lights was an old hunter living in the mountains, with a white beard, kind and gentle, warm and hospitable. Surely, seeing an educated youth like me lost in the forest, he would warmly welcome me, first brewing a cup of hot tea before roasting a deer leg for me to eat. The more I thought about it, the hungrier I got, and I wiped the drool from the corner of my mouth with my sleeve.\n\nAs I walked, my mind on the food, I quickly arrived at the entrance of a huge cave, where lights shone brilliantly from deep within. It was odd; the lights had seemed close just moments before, but now they appeared deep inside the cave. Perhaps my hunger was making my eyes play tricks on me.\n\nDriven by the immense temptation of the roasted venison in my imagination, I entered the cave, taking three steps at a time as if they were two, until I reached the dark, gloomy, and lengthy end of the cave. There, the space inside the mountain opened up before me, and my eyes were suddenly met with clarity. I caught sight of five or six young girls walking side by side, chatting and laughing. Despite it being the height of summer, they were dressed in luxurious fur coats of a classical style, seemingly not of modern fashion\u2014except for one girl in season-appropriate blue khaki clothing. With two braided pigtails on her head and an army green canvas bag slung over her shoulder, emblazoned with the slogan \"Serve the People,\" wasn't that Tian Xiaomeng?\n\nIndeed, it was unmistakably Tian Xiaomeng. She was an Educated Youth from Suzhou, while Fatty and I hailed from Fujian. Although all of us were from the south, we weren't particularly close. Mainly because Fatty and I were too mischievous, always causing trouble, and the generally quiet and gentle girls didn't dare get too close to us.\n\nHowever, seeing a familiar face in this strange cave gave me some comfort. I quickened my pace and called out to Tian Xiaomeng, \"Xiao Tian, what are you doing here? Do you have anything to eat?\"\n\nTian Xiaomeng turned her head, saw me, and waved, beckoning me to come closer. I approached and said, \"You seem to be enjoying yourself here, while we nearly got eaten by a Human Bear looking for you. What is this place? Do you have anything to eat? I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.\"\n\nTian Xiaomeng replied, \"I'm so sorry, it's all my fault. I got lost while picking herbs in Lama Gully and was rescued by these kind sisters. They're about to perform a Shadow Puppet Play; you've come at the perfect time. We can watch it together before heading back.\" She then introduced me to the young women beside her, who all spoke with a local accent and were very polite. They offered me some dried deer meat and invited me to join them for the play.\n\nFollowing them further into the cave, I saw a fortress at the heart of the vast space, its towers magnificent and brightly lit, surrounded by mountains of antiques and jade artifacts.\n\nIn front of the city gates, a stage had been set up with paper lanterns and white cloths, behind which sat a dozen masters of the gong, ready to play their music. There was an ancient-looking long table set up in front, adorned with exquisite tea sets and teacups, and a large red agate tray piled high with fruits and pastries.\n\n Three chairs were set before the table, and the fur-clad ladies who had arrived earlier invited Tian Xiaomeng and me to take our seats to the left and right, respectively. The chair in the center remained conspicuously unoccupied, as if awaiting the arrival of someone of importance.\n\nTian Xiaomeng, noticing that there were only three seats while the rest stood behind, felt rather uncomfortable and was inclined to decline the offer. But I, weary and famished, had no patience for such formalities. After all, the people's land is for the people to sit upon. If there's a seat to be had, it matters not who takes it. So, with a nonchalant air, I sat down and began to eat from the spread before me.\n\nPerhaps my hunger was too great, for although the food was exquisite, it lacked any flavor, tasting as if I were chewing wax. After a few bites, the more I thought about it, the stranger it seemed.\n\nAt that moment, two young girls helped an elderly lady, dressed in a luxurious white gown, to walk out from the main entrance and take her place in the central chair.\n\nTian Xiaomeng and I stood up to greet our hostess, and upon seeing the old lady, a sense of oddity grew within me. What era was it now that we still encountered a figure akin to a landlord's wife?\n\nThe old lady nodded at us both and settled into her seat, silent and seemingly waiting for a show to begin.\n\nWith a clap from a young woman standing behind, the musicians and puppeteers of the troupe, upon hearing the signal, began to perform with vigor. The Shadow Puppet Play, originating from the Han and Tang dynasties and also known as 'lamp shadow play,' was a popular folk art. It involved carving figures of characters and animals from donkey hide and manipulating them behind a white screen, accompanied by the rhythms of drums and musical instruments, narrating stories through song. This art form, with its hundreds of plays, had been widely celebrated.\n\nHowever, this art form was inevitably affected during the Cultural Revolution, criticized as a 'poisonous weed' that promoted tales of scholars, beauties, emperors, and generals, and few dared to perform it anymore. I could never have imagined that I would have the opportunity to witness such a performance today. In an era where cultural life was virtually non-existent, this was incredibly captivating. I was so engrossed in the play that I forgot everything else.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet Play featured a series of splendid dramas, first depicting Taizong's dream visit to the lunar palace, followed by Di Qing's nocturnal conquest of Kunlun Pass.\n\nOn the stage, the clash of swords and the movement of soldiers were depicted in thrilling detail, and the drumming music stirred the audience into bursts of applause. I was so entranced that my throat became parched, and I reached for the teacup on the table to quench my thirst. As I did so, I inadvertently glanced at the elderly lady beside me. She was watching the play with a beaming smile, occasionally reaching for the candied fruits and pastries on the table, her cheeks puffing in a peculiar fashion as she chewed, reminiscent of an old monkey sucking on its food.\n\nMy own grandmother, in her old age and without teeth, never ate like that. Confusion took hold of me\u2014was this old lady human or simian? In my disarray, the teacup slipped from my grasp and shattered on the floor. The breaking of the cup was of little consequence, but with it, the old lady's head tumbled to the ground as well. Her severed head continued to gaze at the Shadow Puppet Play, her mouth still chewing incessantly.\n\n The old lady's maidservants hurriedly approached, reverently lifting her severed head and carefully placing it back upon her body.\n\nI knew in my heart that we had encountered a ghost. Seizing Tian Xiaomeng's hand, I dashed towards the cave's exit. Stumbling through the pitch darkness, we tumbled out of the cave. Thunderous roars filled our ears, the ground shook incessantly, and the cave entrance sealed shut behind us, transforming into a massive stone wall. Had we delayed even half a minute longer, we would have been crushed alive between the closing walls.\n\nOutside, dawn had broken. Clutching Tian Xiaomeng's hand, I ran down to the creek at the foot of the mountain. Suddenly, an excruciating pain seized my belly, cold sweat beading on my forehead as I doubled over. It seemed that something was amiss with the food they had given me. I recalled the tales my grandfather told of ghosts offering food\u2014how ghosts and goblins would turn stones, frogs, and maggots into delectable dishes to deceive humans. I shuddered at the thought of what kind of \"ghost bird\" I might have ingested, and the revulsion overwhelmed me, causing me to vomit profusely.\n\nIn my agony, I vaguely noticed two figures approaching. The girl in the lead looked familiar\u2014it was Yanzi. Seeing her brought a sense of relief, and then darkness clouded my vision as I fainted.\n\nWhen I awoke, three days had passed. Yanzi and Fatty had stayed in the tree till dawn, while the Human Bear below had bled to death. They couldn't find me anywhere until they discovered Tian Xiaomeng and me, unconscious by the riverbank.\n\nThroughout those three days, I lay in a coma, feverish with temperatures soaring above forty degrees. Fatty had traversed over a hundred li of mountain paths to fetch a doctor from the county for me. Thanks to my robust constitution, I eventually regained consciousness. As for Tian Xiaomeng, she never came to and was taken home by her relatives for further treatment. Her subsequent fate remained unclear to us.\n\nI shared my ordeal with Yanzi's father, who suggested that I might have stumbled upon a \"Ghost Market,\" also known as \"Ghost Play.\" There was a local legend about the Empress Dowager who, upon her death, had many folk performers buried alive with her as burial objects. In the past, others had witnessed similar phenomena on Ox Heart Mountain.\n\nYet these memories are hazy in my mind, and sometimes I even doubt whether they truly occurred.\n\nMy time as an Educated Youth lasted only half a year\u2014not particularly long, but the memories will never fade. When it was my turn to return home for the Spring Festival, my fate took another significant turn."

                    "name": "Chapter 5 Kangba Kunlun Non-freezing Spring",
                    "content": "In that year's spring, the shadow of war loomed over all of China. The Soviet Union had deployed over a million troops across three army groups along China's northern border. India, a neighbor, was in constant friction with China's border forces, and the island nation, seeing an opportunity amidst the tension, readied themselves for a counteroffensive. Meanwhile, the United States' Seventh Fleet had also entered a state of combat readiness.\n\nThe upper echelons of the Chinese government felt the threat from international hostile forces and continually readjusted their strategic deployment. The military expanded, preparing for both war and famine, digging deep bunkers and stockpiling grain. The masses actively engaged in the Three Defense Drills against nuclear, chemical, and air attacks.\n\nDuring my return to the city to visit my family, someone shared insider information with me. My parents' case would soon be clarified by the organization, proving that my grandfather was not considered a landlord but a middle peasant. Therefore, their release was only a matter of time. Due to the People's Liberation Army's large-scale conscription, an old comrade-in-arms of my father's helped me to enlist as a backdoor soldier.\n\nUncle Chen, my father's comrade-in-arms, was the chief of general staff at the military district. Back when the Ninth Army Corps went to aid Korea, on the icy Gema Plateau, hundreds of thousands of the Volunteer Army encircled the U.S. Army's elite First Division of the Navy's 6th Marine Corps. The U.S. Army's aerial bombs and napalm lit up the night sky like daylight. Braving the steel barrage that formed the U.S. Army's firepower barrier, the Volunteer Army surged like the tide, wave after wave of assaults.\n\nIn that brutal campaign, my father, enduring temperatures below minus forty degrees, carried the severely wounded Uncle Chen from a pile of dead bodies. By the time they reached the aid station, their bodies were frozen together by the blood that coated them, and nurses had to cut through their flesh to separate them. Their friendship transcended the phrase \"friends through life and death.\" Moreover, my parents' historical issue was about to be resolved. For a division staff chief, arranging for the son of an old comrade-in-arms to join the military was no difficult task. In a sense, the Chinese habit of using backdoor connections began in the military.\n\n Uncle Chen asked me what branch of the military I wanted to join, and I told him I wished to be in the Air Force\u2014I heard the pilots get good meals. Uncle Chen chuckled and gave me a playful knock on the head: \"You think flying a fighter jet is that easy? You, my boy, should join the Field Army first, tough it out for a few years, get a promotion, and then I'll transfer you to work at the Military District Office.\" I replied that I'd rather not return to work at a Government Agency; I preferred to stay with the troops on the ground, as office life wasn't for me.\n\nI wanted to go back to Ganggang Camp and say goodbye to Little Fat Swallow and the rest, but time didn't allow it, so I wrote them a letter instead. I felt rather guilty in my heart\u2014joining the army and leaving my good friends behind to toil in the mountains felt like abandoning them in hardship. However, that feeling dissipated after three months; that's when I truly understood how comfortable life as an Educated Youth in the mountains could be.\n\nI was conscripted into a unit that was about to be re-equipped as an armored division. As fate would have it, just after enduring three grueling months at the New Recruit Training Camp, an order from the Central Military Commission came through, and our unit was reassigned to the Sixty-Two Class Soldier Station at the Kunlun Mountain Pass on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our entire division was reformed into Engineering Troops.\n\nIn fact, this turn of events wasn't all that surprising. At that time, military units across the country were engaged in digging bunkers for civil defense construction\u2014various types of bunkers for air defense, ammunition storage, strategic concealment, and so on. Virtually no military unit was exempt from digging. What set my unit apart was the shift from amateur to professional digging. Our task was top secret: to construct a massive Underground Battle Readiness Facility deep within the Kunlun Mountains. Although the soldiers were not explicitly informed of the facility's purpose, anyone with a bit of sense could probably guess. There were strict confidentiality rules within the troops, so we never discussed this matter. Rumors circulated that upon completion of this engineering mission, we might be reassigned back into the Field Army.\n\nThe Kunlun Mountain Pass, also known as the Kunlun Pass, is situated at an altitude that geologically qualifies as Perennially Frozen Desert Terrain, composed of ancient, heavily eroded Complex Metamorphic Rock. From top to bottom, our division, other than being adept at trench digging, knew nothing about civil engineering or construction. Therefore, many engineers and technicians were sent to guide the work and conduct an intensive five-month training for the Combatants. My squad was chosen as the Advance Small Squad to first head south, passing through the Non-freezing Spring, and enter the vast depths of the Kunlun Mountains. Our mission was to scout for concealed locations suitable for construction.\n\n The Non-freezing Spring is located on the northern bank of the Kunlun River, also known as Kunlun Spring. A circle of granite slabs forms the pool's edge, within which the clear spring water has gushed forth ceaselessly for thousands of years, never freezing, even in the harshest of winters. No one knows where the spring's source lies beneath. Orders from above have been relayed, instructing soldiers not to bathe there, as the local Tibetan people regard the Non-freezing Spring as a divine source and often worship its waters. When Tibet was first liberated, the advancing army passed by this place; at that time, these rules had not yet been established. Three soldiers who bathed in the spring drowned in its depths, allegedly due to the high concentration of nitrate sulfur in the water. Their graves are situated not far from here, at a military post, where our small squad's final supply station is also located.\n\nFinally, we entered the Kunlun Mountains, where nearly everyone suffered severe altitude sickness. Everyone's face turned a shade of purple, their gazes blurry, as if illusions had taken hold in our eyes. The majestic Kunlun, with its thousands of hills and ravines, seemed like an endless procession of silver-gray giant dragons. And our small squad, comprising just over a dozen people, appeared even less significant than a tiny ant in these vast and powerful ranges.\n\nWhile marching, I remembered the book passed down from my grandfather. It said that the Kunlun peaks, rising five thousand meters, are the ancestors of all dragon veins in the world. These mountain ranges have buried countless secrets since ancient times, and it is said that the mausoleum of the hero king of Tibetan mythology, King Gesar, and the gateway to the Demon Nation are both hidden within these undulating peaks.\n\nIn ancient Tibetan customs, sky burial is not the highest honor. The highest form of burial is a tower burial, according to the Book Alliance."

                    "name": "Chapter 6: 100 Skins of Beautiful Women",
                    "content": "The Vanguard Team's mission was to find a suitable construction site, accompanied by two engineers, a surveyor, and a geological prospector. After abandoning their vehicle, they trekked through the mountains for two full days. As dusk approached on the second day, they pitched their tents for rest under a sky heavy with leaden clouds, from which sparse snowflakes began to drift down, hinting at a heavy snowfall come nightfall.\n\nThe four engineering technicians, all bespectacled intellectuals, included one woman among them. They were far from acclimated to the harsh highland environment, gasping for breath inside the tent, their labored breathing causing concern for their frail physiques.\n\nThe Company Instructor, the Squad Leader, and the medic, three in leadership, were busy tending to them\u2014pouring water, offering medicine, and urging them to eat, for the less they ate, the more acute the oxygen deprivation felt.\n\nThe soldiers, robust from the rigors of military training\u2014which included daily five-kilometer cross-country exercises with full gear\u2014had a strong capacity to adapt to the environment. By now, they had mostly adjusted to the thin air. Using specially made white coal briquettes, they lit a fire for warmth. The soldiers huddled together, eating their half-cooked noodles and compressed biscuits, as the high altitude prevented water from boiling properly, leaving the noodles only partly done.\n\nA few comrades-in-arms, who I was quite familiar with, included the tall lads from Heilongjiang in the northeast, a Tibetan soldier named Gawa from the Tibetan Region, and Xiao Lin, a sixteen-year-old signalman from Jilin. After hastily consuming our noodles and catching our breath, we felt that just having a meal on the plateau required more effort than a cross-country march on the plains.\n\nAfter resting a bit, Xiao Lin said to me, \"Brother Hu, you're a city soldier, knowledgeable about many things. Tell us some stories, will you?\"\n\nThe tall fellow chimed in, \"Yeah, Old Hu, I just love listening to you talk. It's so engaging. Anyway, we've got to hold a platoon meeting later and can't rest just yet. So go on, tell the comrades a story.\"\n\nGawa, whose Mandarin was broken but understandable, also seemed eager to say something. After opening his mouth several times without finding the words, he simply waved at me, which I took to mean, \"Go ahead, I'd like to listen too.\"\n\nWith a tongue-in-cheek air, I replied, \"With such thin air up here, how come you guys are still so spirited? Since the comrades want to listen, I'll keep it casual for now. But if the Squad Leader gives me a hard time during the platoon meeting later, you all have to back me up.\"\n\nI said this because our Squad Leader wasn't too fond of me. He had enlisted from the countryside and, like a young bride, had toiled in the army for five years before becoming a Squad Leader. He particularly disliked me, a soldier from the city. Every time there was a meeting, he'd make me speak, then criticize me at length for any slip of the tongue I made\u2014it had almost become a ritual, and it infuriated me beyond words.\n\nBut what should I talk about? I had read fewer than ten books in total, which included four volumes of Mao Zedong's Selected Works, a book of quotations, a dictionary, the novel \"Red Sun,\" and \"Youth Guards\" could count as another. However, I had already told them all about these. There was also a book on \"Feng Shui Secret Technique,\" but I figured they wouldn't understand that.\n\n After racking my brains, I finally remembered a book I had borrowed from Tian Xiaomeng during the time I went to the countryside; it was a popular folk legend manuscript of that era. The content of this handwritten volume primarily revolved around the exploits of the Plum Blossom Party and was interspersed with a variety of strange and wondrous tales circulating in society at the time. Among these, the story of the \"Hundred Skins of Beautiful Women\" left an especially deep impression on me.\n\nThe narrative began on a train journey from Beijing to Nanjing. Zhao Pingping, a female university student, was traveling back to Nanjing to visit her family. Across from her sat a young and handsome officer from the People's Liberation Army. The two struck up a conversation, rather intentionally or by chance, and Zhao Pingping found herself captivated by the young officer's demeanor and eloquence. As they talked, she learned that he came from a well-to-do family and was highly educated, prompting her to daydream about marrying him. Before they knew it, the train had arrived at Nanjing Station. The officer invited Zhao Pingping to a nearby restaurant to sit down for a meal. During the meal, he stepped out to make a phone call and returned with a letter, entrusting her to deliver it to his family in Nanjing. He explained that he had to return to his unit immediately due to an urgent mission and could not visit his home. Zhao Pingping agreed without hesitation, and after a reluctant farewell, they parted ways.\n\nThe next day, Zhao Pingping went to deliver the letter to the officer's home, where she was greeted by an elderly woman. The woman read the letter and then cordially invited Zhao Pingping inside for a cup of tea. After a few sips and some idle chatter with the old woman, Zhao Pingping suddenly felt the world spinning around her, and she collapsed to the floor. She was jolted awake by a bucket of ice-cold water and found herself stripped and bound to a human-peeling stand, surrounded by walls adorned with human skins. Several people stood around her, including the old woman and her burly henchmen. The old woman held the letter in front of Zhao Pingping's eyes for her to read; it contained only one sentence: \"Delivering the hundredth skin of a beautiful woman, please accept with thanks.\" The old woman sneered, \"You're at death's door, so I'll let you die knowing the truth. We are all undercover agents, and we peel the skins of women to pack them with explosives. We needed to prepare a hundred human skins, and today we finally have enough.\" She handed a sharp skinning knife to one of her subordinates, instructing him to begin the gruesome task. The knife, specially designed for skinning, was placed at the top of Zhao Pingping's head, and amidst her screams...\n\nI was just getting to the exciting part when the Second Squad Leader interrupted me, \"Enough, enough. Hu Bayi, you're at it again with your wild stories. Right now, our squad is in the middle of conducting a squad affairs discussion meeting. You love to talk, don't you? Well, this time we'll let you have your say\u2014is it relevant or not to the Book Alliance?\""

                    "name": "Chapter 7: The Great Glacier",
                    "content": "I rose to my feet, snapped to attention, and mimicked the Squad Leader's accent as I responded: \"No, no, why should it always fall to me? It's Lamu Tso's turn, that little Ga Wa should have a say for once. Equality for all is the principle of socialism, after all.\"\n\nThe Second Squad Leader said, \"Little Hutong Zhi, why do you always have such odd things to say? I told you not to mimic me. I am the Squad Leader. When I say speak, you speak. Don't bring up Absolute Egalitarianism\u2014do you understand?\"\n\nI glanced around at the several comrades-in-arms. Each one of them sat in earnest anticipation of my words. Taking advantage of the Squad Leader's inattention, Ga Wa even stuck out his tongue at me. This bunch, they're really too much. Now I had to find a way to gracefully extricate myself: \"Report to the Squad Leader, you haven't yet told us what today's discussion topic is. Without you telling us, how can we speak?\"\n\nAt that moment, Instructor Li Jian walked over. In his thirties, of medium build, he was a refined man and a veteran soldier of over a decade. He treated officers and soldiers well, without putting on airs. Approaching, he said to everyone, \"Comrades, I see you're having a meeting. I'll listen in too.\"\n\nThe Second Squad Leader promptly saluted the instructor, who waved his hand and said, \"Carry on, don't let me interrupt your discussion.\"\n\nWith the instructor standing by, the Second Squad Leader, who was of limited capability, became especially nervous, unsure of what to say. Perhaps thinking singing would be simpler, he said to the soldiers, \"Comrades, let's sing a Revolutionary Song together to boost our morale. Shall we?\"\n\nThe soldiers answered in unison, their response nearly causing the instructor to laugh out loud. He quickly pretended to cough twice to cover it up.\n\nThe Second Squad Leader, oblivious to the humor, maintained a stern face and raised his hands in the manner of a music conductor: \"Comrades, I'll start us off. 'Erlang Mountain,' prepare, sing!\"\n\n\"Erlang Mountain, no matter how high you tower, the People's Liberation Army's ironclad men, resolved to forge ahead, unafraid of the wind's howl, unafraid of the snow's flutter, determined to build that highway, all the way to Tibet.\" As the snow in the sky fell thicker and thicker, the chorus of a dozen soldiers resonated amidst the swirling white of the Kunlun Mountains. It was unclear whether the vast, flying snow accentuated the grandeur of the Military Song, or if the soldiers' singing adorned the desolate loneliness of the Kunlun Mountains. For a moment, even the engineers in another tent were drawn by the song, forgetting their altitude sickness as they gazed at the endless peaks, their minds ebbing and flowing with the music.\n\nFinally, the instructor addressed everyone: \"Like all of you, this is my first time at the Kunlun Mountains. The conditions here are indeed very harsh, the environment extremely severe. We are facing the sternest of tests. But my comrade brothers, we are no ordinary troops. Our unit is known as the Heroic Bayonet Brigade. This honor was earned by our predecessors with their lives and blood. We cannot under any circumstances tarnish this banner. The Central Party Committee has entrusted us with this Glorious Task, showing immense trust in our sixth company. We must display our Revolutionary Military Style that fears neither hardship nor death to complete this mission successfully. Comrades, do we have the resolve?\"\n\n Together, we answered affirmatively.\n\nThe instructor nodded with satisfaction and continued, \"Get some rest early today. Our Small Squad will be crossing the Great Glacier tomorrow. Everyone needs to be well-prepared in advance. Dismissed.\"\n\nOn the third morning of our venture into the mountains, Small Squad arrived at the Great Glacier. Legend had it that nearby lay a very low-lying basin, which was the destination of our journey. As this was a secret mission, we could not enlist local guides for direction\u2014indeed, there was no one who knew the way. We had to rely on a roughly made military map, searching for our destination amidst the chaotic contour lines.\n\nThe Great Glacier consisted of three parts, with a dramatic height difference and steep slopes. Its highest point soared over six thousand meters, where the snow never melted. In the middle, a long stretch resembled a slick, mirror-like surface of cold ice, with layers reaching hundreds of meters in thickness. At the bottom, it dipped below the average elevation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, carving deeply into the earth like a fissure, creating a rare belt of green vegetation. Here, the warmth of the earth fostered life, and the plateau reaction lessened. To continue deeper into the Kunlun Mountains, one had to traverse the valleys beneath the Great Glacier.\n\nBefore departure, an engineer had warned us that while marching beneath the glacier, any loud noise could trigger an avalanche, burying us alive.\n\nEveryone dared not even breathe too heavily, yet an accident still befell us midway. While descending from the glacier into the valley, an engineer from Beijing lost his footing and plummeted. We found his mangled body in the oasis beneath the glacier. Geological prospector Luo Ning, his colleague from the same unit, upon witnessing this tragic scene, could hardly restrain herself from bursting into loud sobs.\n\nA geologist surnamed Wang quickly covered her mouth with his hand, whispering, \"Don't cry out loud.\"\n\nLuo Ning buried her head deep into Engineer Wang's chest, sobbing in agony. The instructor took the lead in removing his hat, paying silent tribute to the fallen comrade, and then Ga Wa and I gathered the engineer's remains into a bag to bury him. This engineer had been with us for less than three days; I only knew he was from Beijing, and before I even had the chance to learn his name, he was gone without a trace.\n\nA tall man started to gently dig into the earth with an engineer's shovel. After a few scoops, a blue fireball, the size of a basketball, suddenly shot out from the pit he had dug. It circled in the air twice before plunging into the crowd, causing members of the Small Squad to hastily dodge in all directions.\n\nAs the fireball hit the ground, the blue flames gradually extinguished, revealing a bizarrely shaped little ladybug. Its entire body resembled red transparent crystal, and its wings were even more translucent and lustrous. Through its clear carapace, one could faintly see the semi-transparent innards, within which seemed to flow a faint flame, giving it an indescribably mysterious and eerie appearance.\n\n The group exchanged glances, each wanting to ask what kind of insect this was, yet no one could possibly provide an answer. It was likely an undiscovered species. Engineer Wang, driven by curiosity, leaned in closer, pushing up his thick, nearsighted glasses, and excitedly pinched the beetle, which resembled a red flame, between his fingers. He examined it meticulously with great care. However, at that very moment, the spot where his fingers touched the beetle ignited with a blue flame. In an instant, the fierce fire engulfed his entire body.\n\nEngineer Wang was consumed by the blue flames, and large blisters quickly formed on his skin before bursting open. The glasses on his nose melted out of shape and fell to the ground as he twisted and writhed in agony on the floor.\n\nIt was too late to save him. His screams, as he was burned by the fire demon, echoed through the valley, sending chills down everyone's spine. It appeared he wouldn't succumb to death for quite some time.\n\nSomeone thought to shovel dirt over him to extinguish the flames, but the burns covered one hundred percent of his body, a deep burn injury. Even if the fire on him could be temporarily put out, in the remote depths of Kunlun Mountain, devoid of medical supplies, he wouldn't last more than an hour or two. It would only prolong his suffering.\n\nThe sight of a living person being burned alive was too cruel to bear. Luo Ning turned her head away, unable to watch any longer. Her expression froze as she covered her ears, her mouth agape, unsure if she wanted to cry out or scream. Xiao Lin, the youngest among them, was terrified and hid behind the taller figures, his whole body quivering.\n\nThe Second Squad Leader drew his pistol, intending to end Engineer Wang's suffering, as he couldn't bear to watch him in such torment. Moreover, if his screaming continued, it could very well trigger an avalanche.\n\nThe instructor restrained the Second Squad Leader's hand as he was about to pull the gun bolt and whispered, \"Don't shoot. Use the bayonet. Let me do it.\"\n\nThousands of tons of snow hung precariously atop the Great Glacier, where any slight noise could lead to catastrophic consequences. The only mercy they could offer Engineer Wang now was to plunge a bayonet into his heart, granting him a swift death.\n\nWithout hesitation, the instructor took a Type 56 semi-automatic rifle, now fitted with a bayonet, from one of the soldiers, murmured an apology to his comrade brother, closed his eyes, and drove the military dagger into Engineer Wang's heart. Engineer Wang's heart-wrenching cries ceased, and he lay motionless on the ground, the flames still consuming him.\n\nAs the instructor was about to withdraw the bayonet from his chest, the enchanting blue flames flared violently, traveling up the bayonet and along the rifle's barrel.\n\nThe fire spread with alarming speed, not even allowing time for a blink. Before anyone could comprehend what had happened, the instructor was already enveloped in the blue inferno.\n\nThe instructor, much like Engineer Wang, struggled and screamed in agony. Everyone knew him well enough; he was a tough man, seemingly gentle but with the endurance and resilience of the finest professional soldier. It was unimaginable, the excruciating pain of being burned by that strange fire, to elicit such a piteous wail from him.\n\n With tears streaming down his face, the Second Squad Leader raised his pistol. He could no longer concern himself with the possibility of triggering an avalanche; he simply couldn't bear to witness the instructor's suffering any longer. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, the instructor, engulfed in flames, suddenly spoke: \"I order none of you to shoot. Take the comrades and leave this place immediately.\"\n\nDespite excruciating pain, the instructor's mind remained lucid. Realizing his screams could set off an avalanche, he silenced himself by turning the glowing-hot bayonet and plunging it into his own heart. After what felt like an eternity, his body was reduced to a pile of fine ash.\n\nThe remaining members of the small squad watched this heroic and tragic scene, their fists clenched, teeth gritted, struggling to hold back the tears welling up in their eyes. Some had bitten their lips so hard they bled.\n\nThe valley lay silent, the deep blue sky reflected on the surface of the Great Glacier, creating an illusion as if there were two identical heavens \u2013 one could not tell which was above and which below. The enchanting beauty of this otherworldly scene was filled with an eerie and terrifying atmosphere.\n\nThere were two piles of ashes on the ground. Just minutes ago, they had been alive, and now they were reduced to tiny mounds, burned to the point where not even bone fragments remained. If no one had witnessed what had transpired, who could believe that such events could occur in this world?\n\nSuddenly, from the ashes where Engineer Wang had been incinerated, a blue fireball shot out. It hovered in mid-air, facing the crowd as if choosing its next target. With incredible speed within its range, it seemed no one could escape its attack. A faint vibration filled the air, likely the sound of the strange beetle's wings fluttering in flight.\n\nNow, the small squad had lost three of its key members, including the leading instructor and two engineers. The two remaining engineers were Surveyor Luo Ning and Worker Liu from the Shanghai Geological Survey Institute. It seemed the mission was doomed to fail.\n\nWithout the instructor, the soldiers felt as though they had lost their main source of courage. Yet facing the sinister blue fireball, nearly everyone shared the same thought: they would rather be buried alive by an avalanche than be burned to ashes by this ghostly thing.\n\nA few impatient soldiers had already raised their guns, aiming at the beetle in the sky, when the Second Squad Leader suddenly stepped forward and said, \"Comrades, the instructor has sacrificed himself, and now I am your captain. I order you all to make it back alive, do you understand?\"\n\nI understood what the Second Squad Leader intended to do; he was planning to sacrifice himself to buy time for the others to retreat. I grabbed his arm, choking back tears: \"No, you're not even a Party member, why should you go? If anyone should, it should be me.\"\n\nThe Second Squad Leader pushed my hand away, \"You little Hu, you're not even a league member. I told you not to mimic me, why won't you listen?\" Before his words were fully spoken, he had already charged towards the hovering fireball without looking back."

                    "content": "The Second Squad Leader had barely taken two steps forward when he abruptly stopped. Before us unfolded an inconceivable scene: a single Bizarre Ladybug Emitting a Flame Aura had split into three identical copies.\n\nOne of the three Blue Fireballs lunged directly at the Second Squad Leader, while the other two darted into the crowd like lightning. Including the Second Squad Leader, Chef Old Zhao, and Communications Officer Xiao Lin, three were struck by the fireballs. Their bodies erupted into flames, and they let out harrowing screams as they writhed and struggled on the ground, desperately trying to smother the engulfing blaze.\n\nA horrifying turn of events ensued. In the face of the fireballs, the soldiers had become so tense that they had all disengaged their weapons' safety catches, and the bullet magazines were fully chambered.\n\nCommunications Officer Xiao Lin, a mere sixteen years of age, lacked the courage and mental fortitude of the instructor and the Second Squad Leader in facing death. The devilish flames stripped away his sanity. In the agony of being bitten by the searing flames, his semi-automatic rifle discharged unintentionally with a series of heavy reports\u2014tat-dang, tat-dang, tat-dang, tat-dang. Amidst the heavy gunfire, three comrades were struck by stray bullets and fell into pools of their own blood.\n\nThe situation deteriorated rapidly. The instructor would rather take his own life than allow us to open fire, but in the end, someone did shoot. The attack by the strange firebug was terrifying, but it paled in comparison to the horror of an avalanche triggered by gunfire. An avalanche inherently meant a Catastrophe of Annihilation; not a single member of the Small Squad would survive. In the valley beneath the Great Glacier, shouting might only have a thirty percent chance of causing an avalanche, but gunfire was two hundred percent likely to bring about the most dreadful outcome.\n\nUpon witnessing the delirious Xiao Lin's rifle misfire, which accidentally killed three comrades, I didn't have time to think. Gritting my teeth, I raised my rifle and with three bursts, I brought down Xiao Lin, the Second Squad Leader, and Old Zhao, all of whom were still struggling painfully in the fire.\n\nThe gunshot sounds of the rifle bullets echoed through the valley. The narrowness of the valley, coupled with the mirror-like ice walls of the Great Glacier, turned it into a natural large speaker. Gunfire, screams, and cries reverberated in waves through the valley, unceasingly.\n\nI had not yet freed myself from the torment of having shot my own comrades; their voices and smiles before death haunted my mind, blurring my consciousness. Suddenly, I felt a chill on my head and, coming back to my senses, touched it to find a snowflake had landed on my forehead.\n\nThe weather was clear, and the sun hung in the sky, shimmering with dazzling light\u2014snowfall was impossible at that moment. The instant I touched the snowflake, a dreadful realization sank in my heart: the avalanche had finally begun.\n\nAt that moment, from the still-burning bodies of the three fallen comrades, a Blue Fireball rose from each. Now, there was no longer any need to hold back from shooting. Gawa, whose marksmanship was the most accurate among the small squad members, raised his rifle without aiming and fired three shots. Each bullet struck the center of a fireball. The insects inside were not as large as the caliber of the bullets; the bodies of the insects were completely obliterated by the bullets, and the flames disappeared with them.\n\n After a brief and brutal skirmish, of the ten of us from our squad\u2014eight soldiers plus the Second Squad Leader and one instructor\u2014only Big Guy, Little Wa, and I remained, along with two intellectuals, Worker Liu and Luo Ning.\n\nThe snowflakes falling from above grew denser, and a thunderous rumble filled the sky. The entire valley quaked. I looked up to see a storm of snow swirling above, like a white tsunami engulfing the sky, rolling towards our valley with overwhelming force.\n\nBig Guy yanked me and shouted, \"Old Hu's Mother, stop gawping and leg it!\" (slang for \"What are you looking at? Hurry up and move!\")\n\nOur position was in the middle of the valley, which was certain to be leveled by the avalanche. There was nowhere to run, but at this life-or-death moment, it's human instinct to make one last desperate struggle.\n\nLuo Ning had already fainted from fear. Big Guy hoisted her onto his shoulder, while Little Wa and I dragged Worker Liu as we ran towards the opposite side of the Great Glacier, hoping to climb the slightly higher slopes before the avalanche hit, vying for that last sliver of a chance at life.\n\nIn our most desperate moment, we did not abandon our guns. A gun is a part of a soldier's life; to discard it is to discard one's honor. But everything else was left behind, all equipment forsaken. We wanted to shed our backpacks too, but in our haste, we couldn't manage it. The five survivors clung to each other and ran wildly.\n\nThe avalanche was upon us too quickly, a sweeping force that shook the valley with the energy of collapsing snow. The ground shook and the mountains trembled.\n\nI had heard about avalanches, but never could I have imagined a force of nature as powerful as this Silver Giant Wave. Everyone felt a sense of finality, knowing that no amount of speed could outrun it.\n\nYet, fortune favors the brave, and the violent tremors from the avalanche cracked open a steep, downward-sloping fissure in the mountain slope before us.\n\nWith the snowstorm almost upon us, we had no time to think. We charged into the crevice. The slope was steeper than expected, and we fell, tumbling down and crashing at the bottom of a large hole.\n\nThen, a massive slab of snow rolled down from above, sealing the crevice perfectly and kicking up a cloud of snowflakes that made us cough violently. The thunderous noise above lasted a long while before it quieted down. Judging by the sounds, the snow above must have buried us under countless tons.\n\nIn the darkness, we could not see anything. After a long time, someone finally spoke up with a thick Northeastern Accent\u2014it was Big Guy. He asked, \"Anyone who can still breathe, make a sound. Old Hu, Little Ga Wa, Worker Liu, Luo the Worker, are you all there?\"\n\nI felt like my body had almost fallen apart from the fall and was in too much pain to speak. I just grunted twice to show I was still alive.\n\nLittle Wa responded and took out a flashlight, illuminating our surroundings. Luo Ning sat on the ground with a vacant stare, seemingly unhurt. Worker Liu lay beside him, unconscious, his eyes tightly shut. His left shinbone was broken, the white of the bone protruding out."

                    "content": "We had tumbled into a narrow and deep crevice in the mountain, the beam of our flashlights unable to penetrate the encompassing darkness. Limited visibility cloaked the distant terrain in mystery.\n\nThe tall man felt for Worker Liu's breath and, with a shake of his hand, despairingly uttered, \"It's over, he's not breathing.\"\n\nCrawling over, I touched Worker Liu's carotid artery. He was indeed gone\u2014no heartbeat. I sighed and said to the tall man, \"Let's bury Worker Liu.\"\n\nI took out an Engineer Soldier spade to dig a hole, but Ga Wa stopped me, pointing to the ground: \"Bugs, fire.\"\n\nGa Wa's reminder brought back the memory of when we tried to bury a fallen engineer in the valley and unearthed a devilish ladybug. Out of the Small Squad's fourteen, ten perished in those harrowing minutes. It seemed the earth here was not to be disturbed lightly, who knew what ghostly things lurked beneath.\n\nI had an intuition that the bizarre insect was no simple mysterious creature. After it set two people ablaze, it split from one into three. Was it merely a coincidence? I couldn't make sense of it.\n\nHowever, we couldn't just leave our comrade's body exposed. We had to find a compromise. Illuminated by my flashlight, Ga Wa and the tall man gathered stones to cover Worker Liu's body, constructing a rudimentary stone tomb.\n\nThroughout this process, Luo Ning sat motionless on the ground, silently watching over Worker Liu's stone grave. Eventually, unable to contain her grief any longer, she burst into tears, releasing the sorrow that had been dammed in her heart.\n\nI wanted to comfort her but found myself at a loss for words. Her crying touched a nerve, and my heart ached as if being cut with a knife. I thought of the previous night when the Small Squad had gathered around the campfire, belting out military songs. The echoes of those resonant voices seemed to linger in my ears, yet today, most of our comrades lay forever beneath the great glaciers of the Kunlun Mountains.\n\nI helped Luo Ning to her feet, and together we observed a moment of silence for Worker Liu and the other comrades. In those times, any occasion warranted quoting the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. I led with, \"The sky is blanketed with white; the urgency of marching through the snow is palpable.\"\n\nThe other three joined in chorus, \"Over hills and under mountains, the wind unfurls the red flag across the pass. Only the many ambitions sacrificed dare to command the sun and moon to usher in a new sky.\"\n\nWe then raised our right fists in oath, \"We wish our great leader longevity without boundaries, longevity without boundaries. May our intimate comrades-in-arms enjoy robust health, everlasting health. Comrades-in-arms, comrades, please rest assured in your departure. Some deaths are as light as feathers, while others as heavy as Mount Tai. To die for the people's interests is to weigh more than Mount Tai, and you have sacrificed for the people's interests. We must inherit the legacy of the revolutionary martyrs, follow in the footsteps stained red with their blood, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. The final victory will always belong to us, the workers.\"\n\nAt that time, I was still a new recruit, never having attended a comrade-in-arms' memorial service. I didn't know what to say, only that this was how others spoke at meetings. In such circumstances, there was no question of appropriateness.\n\n After a long while, everyone calmed down from the pain and tended to their wounds, which were fortunately minor and did not impede movement. They ate a few compressed biscuits and gathered to discuss the next steps. It was impossible to exit through the valley crushed by the snowboards\u2014I estimated that the entire valley might have been filled by the avalanche. Our only option was to find another way out.\n\nGawa patted his empty bullet pouch, indicating that our ammunition was running low. When we set out on the mountain, we had to carry a lot of equipment, so we brought only the bare minimum of ammunition: three rifle bullet magazines per person. After all, this wasn't a combat mission, and there weren't any bandits in the area, so we had been somewhat negligent in our planning. During the avalanche, we had lost some of our ammunition, and now each of us had only about twenty bullets left on average, and we had a total of two hand grenades. Underground, there wouldn't be many wild beasts, so having a surplus of bullets was unnecessary\u2014as long as we had enough for self-defense.\n\nWe had no more provisions; we had consumed everything edible. We had to find an exit within two days, or else we would starve to death underground. Fortunately, Luo Ning still had a compass on him.\n\nThe depth of the mountain crevice was beyond imagination. After heading south for a while, we reached a dead end. The crack in the earth turned north, and it felt as if we were walking beneath the Great Glacier.\n\nWe walked in the darkness for over ten hours, and as we proceeded, the terrain descended, and the underground space expanded. Luo Ning checked the barometer, and according to the air pressure, which translated to an altitude of just over four hundred meters, we were at a level comparable to Sichuan, far below the average altitude of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. If we kept descending at this rate, we might as well reach the center of the earth.\n\nFinally, the terrain leveled out, and the sound of a rushing underground river reached our ears, suggesting that one wasn't far away. Seeing no further descent, I shone my flashlight around, looking for an upward path, when suddenly, the beam reflected off the rock wall, creating countless faint glimmers, like light on shattered mirrors.\n\nLuo Ning exclaimed, \"Mica!\"\n\nThe rest of us, not knowing what mica was, mistook her alarm for a sign of emergency and quickly shielded Luo Ning behind us. We swiftly unslung our Type 56 semi-automatic rifles and racked the gun bolts, ready to shoot.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Luo Ning asked, puzzled.\n\nWhile maintaining a defensive stance with my rifle, I asked Luo Ning, \"What 'mother' or 'father' are you talking about?\"\n\n\"It's not an animal,\" Luo Ning clarified. \"I mean, the surroundings are full of crystal bodies. Mica and quartz often grow in the same stratum, so there might also be quartz here.\"\n\nAlthough Luo Ning mainly handled cartographic duties, she often worked with geological exploration teams and knew quite a bit about geology. The crystal bodies around us, resembling thin glass shards, were monoclinic crystals that only appeared in ancient dual-quality rock layers. The underground reserves in Hebei were substantial, but the color of the mica here was exceptionally deep, forming large hexagonal columns, far surpassing the quality of what was found in Lingshou County in inland Hebei. The depth of the mica's color indicated that our current location was unimaginably deep.\n\nAttracted by the rare large mica surrounding us, Luo Ning examined one piece after another. I picked up a small piece and looked at it but couldn't see anything particularly remarkable.\n\nSuddenly, I heard the big guy shouting at Gawa, \"Lamu Tso, what are you doing? Get up quickly.\"\n\nShining my flashlight, I saw Gawa prostrating on the ground, performing full body prostrations in the Tibetan manner. I wondered who he was bowing to. Then, shining the light ahead of him, I couldn't help but draw a sharp breath.\n\n Beneath the earth stood a colossal Wooden Tower, constructed from thousands of massive timbers. Its surface was speckled with countless red glimmers, which, upon closer inspection in the dim light, revealed the tower's base to be nearly two hundred meters wide, built from packed earth and stone. The body of the tower was made of thousand-year-old cypress wood, rising up into nine distinct layers. Each level was filled with the desiccated skeletons of people in ancient garb, men and women, young and old. Every timber was etched with the secret scripts of the Tibetan people. Could this be a tomb? Its scale was immense; who could have built such a structure underground?\n\nI went over to the little Ga Wa, who was prostrating on the ground, and pulled him up. \"Although our Party and Army respect ethnic policies, you, as a Little Ga Wa and a Tibetan, are also a member of the Chinese People's Liberation Army when you don the uniform. As such, you should not indulge in such idealistic nonsense of idealism. We do not permit any engagement in superstitious religious activities.\"\n\nThe tall man chuckled beside us, \"Well done, Old Hu. The kid's got quite the knack for words, could make a good political instructor.\"\n\nLuo Ning had been examining mica but came over when she heard our argument. \n\nI waved at the tall man to stop interrupting and continued questioning Ga Wa, \"Do you recognize the script on this tower?\"\n\nGa Wa shook his head persistently.\n\nI said, \"Kid, if you don't understand it, why prostrate yourself? Did the sight of these bones scare you witless?\"\n\nGa Wa's face was filled with panic as he replied in halting Chinese, \"Hu, this little bear... oh, let me explain, you pulled me over... the Larados Nine-layered Demon Tower.\"\n\nI didn't quite catch the first part of his sentence, but the last four words were clear enough. What was this Nine-layered Demon Tower for, if not to bury the dead?\n\nBefore Ga Wa could respond, Luo Ning ran back from the side of the tower, gesturing for us to be silent. She whispered urgently, \"Don't make a sound, or you'll wake them.\"\n\nSeeing her serious expression, I sensed trouble but didn't know what she was referring to, so I asked in a low voice, \"Wake what, the dead in the tower?\"\n\nLuo Ning replied with intense anxiety, \"No, it's those firefly beetles; they're all sleeping on the corpses, countless in number.\"\n\nOnly then did I realize that the dense red glimmers on the Wooden Tower were the luminescent bodies of those transparent beetles.\n\nAlthough I possessed some of the fearless spirit of a revolutionary soldier, the thought of those peculiar beetles filled me with dread. Such creatures beyond common understanding were too difficult to deal with, and the horrific scene in the valley had left a strong sense of fear in me.\n\nI signaled, and the four of us quietly retreated the way we had come. But before we had gone far, Ga Wa's foot slipped, and he fell into a hidden trench that ran parallel to our path and had gone unnoticed on our way in. The trench was only a little over a meter deep, but Ga Wa still grunted from the fall. I quickly jumped down to help him and saw him clutching his foot in pain.\n\nLuo Ning and the tall man also climbed down into the trench. Shining their flashlights, we saw that Ga Wa's foot had been impaled by a sharp white bone, which had pierced right through his shoe and foot, causing blood to gush out. The trench was filled with layers upon layers of animal bones, too numerous to count. It seemed to be a sacrificial burial pit for animals like oxen and dogs.\n\nTo avoid disturbing the beetles in the nearby Wooden Tower, the tall man covered Ga Wa's mouth to silence his cries. I swiftly pulled the bone from his foot, and Luo Ning sprinkled Yunnan Baiyao from her first aid kit onto his wound, then wrapped it with a white bandage to stop the bleeding.\n\n My hands were stained with the blood from the child's leg, and I wiped them carelessly on my military uniform. A thought suddenly flashed through my mind: the sacrificial burial pit for cattle and horses was oddly shaped\u2014not square or round, but dug into a long trench, leading straight to the wooden tower where the bodies were placed. This form closely resembled a layout mentioned in the Feng Shui secret techniques. If it were exactly the same, then there should be another sacrificial trench of the same scale at a parallel position.\n\nThe two parallel sacrificial trenches flanked the wooden tower structure of the tomb, forming a 'twin dragons playing with a pearl' configuration. Based on this, the trench beside us should contain various artifacts used by the tomb's owner in life. It was unclear whether these trenches were man-made or natural, though the latter seemed more likely.\n\nThe sound of the river's flow nearby was loud, and judging from the roar of the rapids, there was an underground river to the northwest, behind the Nine-layered Demon Tower. Dragons, after all, cannot be separated from water.\n\nIf my conjecture was correct, then the map of this underground world was already in my mind. I just needed to find the other sacrificial trench to confirm my deduction.\n\nThe big guy pushed my shoulder: \"Old Hu, what are you pondering over?\"\n\nI had been lost in thought and only came back to my senses with his push. I asked Luo Ning: \"Luo the Worker, can you estimate our current position on the map?\"\n\nLuo Ning used a compass to reference the map and after a moment's thought, he said: \"We've been continuously heading north underground for over ten hours. According to our pace, we should have passed the Great Glacier overhead and be nearing the exit of the Kunlun Mountains.\"\n\nI shared my thoughts with them. Going back was not an option as it would only lead to the crevices covered by the avalanche. If my estimation was correct, following the underground river should provide us a way out. However, this would mean taking a risk by passing beneath the Nine-layered Demon Tower\u2014a gamble for survival amidst certain death.\n\nAfter discussing it among the four of us, we decided that despite the dangers, it was worth the risk to try. However, I resolved to first confirm my hypothesis by finding the other sacrificial trench.\n\nBefore we set out, I asked the child what exactly the Nine-layered Demon Tower was.\n\nThe child struggled with his Mandarin, but after a while, I managed to understand a part of it. In his hometown of Xuewei, there was a relic identical to this Nine-layered Demon Tower. It was said that such towers were the burial form for the mausoleums of the Demon Nation's royal lineage throughout the ages. When the Demon Nation perished, the tomb had been destroyed by the Hero King, King Gesar. On the Tibetan plateau, only a pile of rotten timber frameworks remained, along with narrative poems passed down by word of mouth among the herdsmen, glorifying King Gesar's unparalleled martial exploits like the sun.\n\nWhen the Tibetan herdsmen passed by these relics, they would bow in worship and chant the epic. This was not out of fear of the Demon Nation king's mausoleum but to express reverence for King Gesar. The child also mentioned some religious matters, which I couldn't understand. Whether those ghostly fire-like insects were the resting spirits from the tomb was also unknown.\n\nLeaving Luo Ning and the other two behind, I crept forward and found another sacrificial trench about a hundred meters away from the Cattle and Horse Sacrificial Burial Trench. Indeed, it contained ancient leather boots, ancient Tibetan wooden scripts, ancient Mongolian wooden scripts, painted wooden pieces, gold-decorated wooden discs, wooden bird and beast figurines, bronze ware, grains, and a large amount of silk and other burial objects.\n\n It seems my conjecture was not amiss; the Underground River beyond the Nine-layered Demon Tower must surely connect to the outside world. Thus, I slipped back to the Animal Burial Trench to summon the other three to action.\n\nI led the way, with the tall man holding his gun behind me, followed by the lad, whose thorn-wounded foot was not light, and Luo Ning bringing up the rear, supporting him as he walked.\n\nThe Nine-layered Demon Tower was vast in scale. The Underground Cavern was originally extremely spacious, but the tower and the large expanses of Mica Handle nearly choked off the northern path, leaving only narrow spaces on either side barely passable.\n\nWe passed under the Wooden Tower with bated breath, and upon seeing those beetles flickering with a fiery aura inside the tower, it felt as though our hearts were about to leap from our throats. Throughout the two-hundred-meter journey beneath the tower, each step felt impossibly distant.\n\nHaving painstakingly edged past the Nine-layered Demon Tower and walked less than two hundred paces forward, the ground beneath my feet suddenly gave way, as if I had stepped on some enormous creature. Shining my flashlight, I discovered beneath my feet a colossal reptilian animal I had never seen before. It flicked its long tongue, its skin color closely resembling that of the ground, somewhat like a Giant Lizard in appearance, yet akin to a crocodile in shape, but without the rough hide. Its snout was not as pointed as a lizard's, rather more rounded, and its tongue, red and long like a snake's, forked at the end. Its pitch-black skin was covered in large white spots, and from its appearance alone, it could be described as a large frog with a long tail.\n\nIn my life, I fear neither heaven nor earth, but I have a particular aversion to such repulsive creatures. Startled, I instinctively shrank behind the tall man, who also caught sight of the peculiar animal and was equally taken aback. Perhaps a soldier's only true companion is his rifle, and acting on instinct, he raised his gun and fired a burst. The reptile writhed a few times and then lay dead.\n\nAt this moment, Luo Ning, who had been walking at the back, came over and looked at the animal's carcass on the ground. He exhaled and said to us, \"This is a Salamander that dwells underground, feeding on insects and mayflies, harmless to humans.\"\n\nI was not particularly saddened by the death of an animal; my concern was the tall man's reckless gunfire, which might awaken the insects in the tower. When misfortune strikes, it seems even a sip of cool water can choke you. The beetles in the Nine-layered Demon Tower were evidently stirred by the gunshots, as countless lantern-like Blue Fireballs lit up.\n\nThe entire underground space was bathed in blue firelight, and the Wooden Tower too was ignited. The flames grew larger and larger, with hundreds of fireballs hurling towards us. Amid such a great blaze, we felt not a hint of warmth but were instead besieged by a bone-chilling cold that made our teeth chatter.\n\nSeeing the dire situation, the tall man reached for the two Hand Grenades attached to his Armed Belt, ready to pull the pins and hurl them at the fireballs. I quickly pressed down on his hand, \"Throw one, and save the last as an Honor Bullet for us. I have no desire to die by that Ghost Fire.\" Book Alliance"

                    "content": "Our standard-issue infantry weapon, the Wooden Handle Grenade, consists of three parts: a cylindrical top wrapped in sheet metal and a wooden handle below. Once the pin is pulled, the explosive charge within propels shrapnel from the metal casing to harm the enemy, though its power is not particularly formidable.\n\nThe big fellow left behind one Hand Grenade while I took another, noticing numerous fireballs surging forward. I pulled the fuse, and with white smoke hissing from the Wooden Handle Grenade, I hurled it into the fray.\n\nThe Hand Grenade exploded into a cloud of white smoke. The shrapnel struck the dozen or so Blue Fireballs ahead, causing them to fall and extinguish upon the ground. Yet more fireballs continued to swarm in from behind.\n\nLuo Ning led the way, while the remaining three covered the rear, retreating and firing with their Semi-automatic Rifles. With only about twenty Bullets each, they were spent in under two minutes.\n\nTo contend with those Mysterious Ladybugs forming Blue Fireballs, gunfire was the only option. Any slight contact would set oneself ablaze. A rifle without Bullets was no better than a fire poker.\n\nThe big man discarded his rifle and drew his last Hand Grenade, shouting to me, \"Old Hu, it's time. Are we doing this?\"\n\nLuo Ning and I supported the little one, forming a circle with the big man's Hand Grenade at the center. I watched the Hand Grenade before me, knowing that once he pulled the pin, we would all go down together in mere seconds. The final moment had arrived.\n\nIn such times, I refused to dwell on other matters. Not only were the fireballs drawing nearer, leaving no time for distraction, but I also feared that pondering farewells might weaken my resolve. I had always aspired to be a Top-class Combat Hero like Yang Gensi. Yet here I was, not perishing on a battlefield but at the end of my life under Kunlun Mountain, an end I could hardly accept. Steeling my heart, I was ready to signal the big man to detonate the Hand Grenade.\n\nLuo Ning, who had already braced herself for death with eyes tightly shut, suddenly had a realization. She stood up abruptly, pulling us back, \"Listen to the roar of the water! We must be near an Underground River. Let's jump in!\"\n\nCaught up in shooting and the impending suicide by Hand Grenade, we had forgotten about the Underground River. Amidst the chaos, we hadn't noticed the thunderous sound of the water. Luo Ning's words sparked hope of a way out. If we could leap into the river in time, the formidable fireballs might be unable to harm us.\n\nTime was of the essence, and with thousands of Blue Fireballs closing in, the four desperate survivors sprinted towards the sound of the roaring water.\n\nThe water was only about ten meters away. We hadn't run far when, at the end of the Underground Cavern and around a bend, a large waterfall appeared, cascading into a sizable natural Underground Lake.\n\nBefore I could take a closer look, a burning sensation struck my back, a pain as if my heart and liver were being clawed at. Presumably, a fireball had hit me. With mere sparks enough to engulf my body in flames, there was no time for second thoughts. I leaped into the lake.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, I saw the big man and the others, also aflame, screaming as they jumped into the lake one after another. I dove into the water, and the Blue Flame that had caught on me was immediately Extinguished by the Lake Water.\n\n Water and fire are incompatible, and it seemed as though the other insects knew the ferocity of the lake; they hovered a couple of meters above the surface, not daring to plunge down to attack.\n\nI emerged from the water to catch my breath and saw that the big fellow had also surfaced, but Luo Ning and Ga Wa were nowhere to be seen. Concerned they might have drowned, not knowing how to swim, I took a deep breath and prepared to dive back in to rescue them when Luo Ning, supporting Ga Wa, surfaced from the lake.\n\nIt turned out that Ga Wa had never swum in his life. Upon jumping into the lake, he had been overwhelmed by the water and fainted. Luo Ning, who had seen what happened, dove in and brought him to the surface. Fortunately, Ga Wa had not been underwater for long; after coughing up a bit of water, he regained consciousness.\n\nTibetan customs forbid swimming or bathing in lakes, so Ga Wa chanted prayers incessantly, seeking Buddha's forgiveness.\n\nThe lake's surface was brightly illuminated by countless fireballs, as bright as day. The four of us huddled together, and despite it being early spring, we found the underground water not cold but rather warm to the touch, a geothermal effect creating a warm lake.\n\nThe big fellow cursed, \"Damn it, my gun's gone, sunk to the bottom of the lake.\"\n\nI reminded him, \"We're out of bullets anyway. A gun's no use to us now. Let's focus on finding a way out. Keep your head low and watch out for those insects diving down.\"\n\nThe big man scoffed at the idea that the fire-bodied insects could dive into the lake, grinning foolishly. But his smile soon froze as thousands of blue-glowing fireballs gathered into a massive flame and swooshed down toward us. He quickly ducked back under the water.\n\nI took a breath, ready to follow, when I saw Ga Wa paralyzed by shock. He had an innate fear of the water and dared not dive to escape. I had no choice but to forcibly push his head under and drag him by the arm toward deeper waters.\n\nThe fireball, several meters in diameter, touched the lake surface, causing steam to rise. Despite its size, the lake was vast, and the suicidal attack method of the ladybug suicide squad was ineffective; they drowned one by one.\n\nThe lakebed was naturally dim, but the firelight from above allowed us to make out the surroundings within a dozen meters. In the depths, numerous large fish swam slowly. These fish, with their extremely long barbels, resembled mahi-mahi. Adapted to the dark environment, their eyes had degenerated into mere white spots.\n\nStartled by the peculiar appearance of these large fish, I swallowed some water. Glancing at Ga Wa, who was flailing and unable to hold his breath any longer, I guessed the insects had mostly perished and pulled him back to the surface.\n\nThe lake's surface was littered with the dead bodies of the ladybugs, and without the firelight, everything was shrouded in darkness. I called out to the big man, \"Do you still have a flashlight?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Lost everything, nothing left. Guess we're moving in the dark now.\"\n\nSuddenly, there was light. Luo Ning emerged from the water, wiping her face. In her other hand, she held a military L-shaped flashlight. \"It's the last two I have. Luckily, they were in my pocket and didn't fall into the lake.\"\n\nWe helped each other onto the shore, feeling both exhausted and hungry, with no energy left to move. After going without food for over ten hours, even bodies of iron would falter under such strain.\n\nThe big man dove back into the lake and returned with a fish skewered on his bayonet. He scraped off the scales haphazardly and sliced it into pieces. I tried a piece first; the raw fish tasted fine, not too fishy, just slightly bitter, which became savory after chewing more.\n\nOnly Ga Wa, citing religious reasons, refused to eat, adhering to the ethnic discipline of the troops that prohibited consuming fish in Tibet. But considering that the Kunlun Mountains lie on the border between Qinghai and Tibet, and we were technically still on the Qinghai side, where the Hui population outnumbers the Tibetans, eating fish here did not break any rules. In truth, even if it did, we were too famished to care. Special circumstances called for special measures.\n\n Three of us wolfed down a large fish with ravenous hunger and felt a lingering craving for more, so the big guy dived back into the lake to fish. Luo Ning checked the wounds on the child's feet, while I walked around the lake to see if there was any way out. Given the waterfall's powerful flow, there had to be an outlet somewhere.\n\nThe waterfall had a drop of several dozen meters, and Luo Ning surmised that the water system before us was likely an underground tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Moreover, the possibility of a volcano deep underground could explain the warm temperature of the lake water.\n\nArmed with Luo Ning's L-shaped flashlight, I discovered an opening in the underground lake through which water flowed out. The waterway was a cave about seven or eight meters high, completely submerged, with no path to walk on. If we wanted to move forward, we would have to swim out through the water.\n\nI returned to Luo Ning and reported what I had seen. Having lost her map and compass, she could only guess our location based on intuition. With years of experience in surveying, she estimated we were not far from the Non-freezing Spring, which, even in the depths of winter, did not freeze, suggesting the presence of underground magma. The problem was finding a way back to the surface; constantly wandering underground was not a solution. The only viable plan was to follow the river, as only where there was a river would there not be a dead end.\n\nThe big guy came back disheartened, having caught no fish this time. Unwilling to linger, the three of us, all strong swimmers, supported the child between us and swam downstream toward the far end of the cave.\n\nAlthough not wide, the underground river had a strong undercurrent. With the help of the rushing water, we floated and swam with little effort. However, the tunnel was exceedingly long, and the water temperature had risen considerably. The smell of sulfur filled our nostrils, and despite being in the water, we all felt parched.\n\nThe big guy grew restless and complained as we swam, \"We might have made a mistake of left-leaning impulsiveness this time. How come we've swum so long without reaching the end? With such a rapid current, there's not even a place to stand and catch our breath. Maybe we should just turn back.\"\n\nI rebuked him, \"What were you doing earlier? Now that we've come this far, you're asking how much longer the red flag can be waved? Are you doubting whether our revolution can achieve final victory? You're already faltering at the first step of the Long March of Ten Thousand Miles. Bite the bullet and hold on.\"\n\nThe big guy retorted, \"How can you say that? I just want to conserve some strength for the revolution. If you keep going blindly like this and cause a loss to the revolution, who's to blame?\"\n\nWe had only gotten halfway through our conversation when Luo Ning cried out in alarm, \"Look behind us! Is there some animal? It seems like a water monster.\"\n\nI also heard an unusual disturbance in the water behind us, and turning around, I shone the flashlight. The water churned, and a massive shadow approached rapidly from beneath the surface. The flashlight's beam was insufficient to see clearly, but it was clear that the comer meant no good. We each drew our military daggers, bracing for battle."

                    "content": "The undercurrents beneath the river's surface and the force of the Dark Surge grew ever stronger, beyond our control. We were swept helplessly forward by the torrent, while the enormous creature behind us followed as if it were our shadow.\n\nMost of its body submerged, it churned the water into wave after wave of spray. The cavernous river passage was too dark to see; we could only hear the creature, and by the sound of it, it must have been at least seven or eight meters long.\n\nIn the final stretch of the subterranean river, the current intensified. Fearing we would be separated, the four of us clung tightly together, tumbling and spinning into a hole in the riverbed.\n\nBelow lay a vast underground river, its waters scaldingly hot. Countless tributaries, just like the ones we had passed, burst forth from the mountain walls like enormous water cage heads, converging into the main channel below. On both sides, protruding stone orifices emitted jets of white, high-temperature gas. Some crevices even glowed with the dark red of lava. It seemed we had reached the subterranean volcanic zone Luo Ning had mentioned.\n\nThe river's temperature was extreme, and we struggled desperately to climb atop a massive rock on the riverbank, which felt warm to the touch. The nearby glow of molten lava provided enough light, so I turned off my flashlight to conserve the precious battery life. I asked my companions, \"Did any of you get a clear look at that thing behind us? It was enormous.\"\n\nThe tall man and Luo Ning both shook their heads, having seen nothing clearly. Gawa fared the worst, having swallowed a bellyful of river water, his stomach distended and round. He tried to speak but vomited several mouthfuls of water first. Rubbing his belly, he said, \"Oh, I saw that little bear. It fell into the middle of the river behind us.\"\n\nTo be on the safe side, the tall man stood up with a military dagger in hand to survey the nearby river. \"There's no sign of any water monster,\" he said. But as he turned to come back, a blood-red tongue, over two meters long, shot out from the river, coiling around his legs and knocking him to the ground, dragging him towards the water.\n\nThanks to Gawa's quick reflexes, he stabbed the monstrous tongue with his bayonet. The creature, pained by the attack, released the tall man. It emerged from the water, glaring with eyes that glowed red like lanterns.\n\nIt looked exactly like the salamander that the tall man had previously shot dead\u2014its head like a frog's, its body like a skinless crocodile's. But this salamander was colossal, measuring over ten meters in length. Its skin shimmered with iridescent scales, and with a vicious flick of its tail, it watched us menacingly.\n\nI hurriedly asked Luo Ning, \"Luo the Worker, are you sure it doesn't harm humans? Why is this one so huge?\"\n\nLuo Ning was pale, trembling as he replied, \"I said the last one was just a Tyrant Salamander, very aggressive and extinct since the Ice Age. I never imagined they'd still be here.\"\n\nNone of us had anticipated that in this isolated environment, creatures from ancient times, long thought extinct, would still exist.\n\nSalamanders, such creatures of the underground, are cold-blooded. The excessive geothermal heat had rendered this Tyrant Salamander before us incredibly ferocious. Moreover, Gawa had wounded its tongue, and the taste of blood in its mouth had triggered its aggressive instincts. Furthermore, we had no idea if the salamander we had shot was a relative or offspring of this one. In any case, a feud had been established, and it seemed we were now bound to fight to the bitter end.\n\n I signaled with my eyes, and the tall fellow and the little guy understood immediately, flanking the Tyrant Salamander from both sides. Our trio formed a pincer attack, ready for combat.\n\nThe Tyrant Salamander bellowed and hissed, confronting us with bared teeth and brandished claws. Before we could even make a move, it swept its massive tail, knocking the little guy to the ground and coiling around him. With its gaping maw wide open, it lunged to bite. Normally, salamanders don't have teeth, but this Tyrant Salamander's jaws were lined with three rows of sharp fangs, top and bottom. A single bite would be fatal.\n\nIn the face of imminent danger, the tall fellow and I lunged forward. Together, we grappled with the Salamander's gaping jaws from above and below, determined to prevent that lethal bite, or the little guy would lose his head.\n\nWhenever religion was not involved, the little guy would become incredibly brave. Even though his lower body was trapped by the Salamander's tail, his hands never stopped moving. Seeing that the creature was tough-skinned and impervious to both water and fire, he resorted to stabbing fiercely with his bayonet into its mouth.\n\nWounded and enraged, the Tyrant Salamander thrashed about with such strength that it flung all three of us to the ground. The force of its throw was immense; I was hurled against a rock, which left me reeling with a surge of blood and stars dancing before my eyes. The tall fellow fell into the river but quickly scrambled back to shore, his body steaming white and howling in pain from the scalding water.\n\nTo think that we could fight this colossal Tyrant Salamander with just three bayonets was like trying to shatter a rock with an egg. With a collective shout, we turned tail and fled, with the Salamander in hot pursuit.\n\nThe ground was littered with volcanic rocks and ash, soft and slippery, making our escape all the more arduous. To shake off the pursuing behemoth, we climbed the steep volcanic rock at the edge of the river valley, scrambling higher and higher. Halfway up, I heard the tall fellow shouting a warning to me. Glancing down, I saw the Tyrant Salamander scaling the cliff like a giant lizard, mere meters away from me. Its long tongue almost licked my boots. I contemplated jumping down to escape, but the height was too great, and I couldn't be sure of landing in the river. A misstep could mean a fatal crash onto the rocks. Cursing, I freed one hand to draw my bayonet, ready for a cornered beast's last stand\u2014if I was to die, I would take the monster down with me.\n\nThe other three, seeing the Salamander closing in on me, were helpless with frustration. The slope was too steep for them to come to my aid in time. They watched, teeth clenched and eyes fierce, but could do nothing.\n\nThe Book Alliance"

                    "content": "Suddenly, Luo Ning thought of something and, leaning against the rock wall, shouted at me, \"Comrade Little Hu, honor bullet!\"\n\nThe others had the realization at the same time. Yes, we still had one hand grenade left, unused, tucked in the big guy's armed belt all this time. The standard-issue Chinese wooden handle grenades were waterproof. Some soldiers stationed by Qinghai Lake would often use hand grenades to fish in the lake. Despite everyone having fallen into the water earlier, the hand grenade should not have been affected by the moisture. We owed a debt of gratitude to Luo Ning for the reminder.\n\nThe big guy pulled out the hand grenade: \"Old Hu, catch!\" He lobbed it towards me from above.\n\nI quickly clamped the bayonet between my teeth and reached out with my right hand to catch the hand grenade. I used my big thumb to push off the safety cap, spat out the bayonet, and bit down on the pull ring. The fuse of the hand grenade was ignited, hissing as it emitted white smoke.\n\nI looked down and aimed for the tyrant salamander's gaping mouth, throwing the hand grenade into it. The creature, unaware of what a hand grenade was, saw the dark object flying towards it and, following its hunting instincts, snatched it with its long tongue and swallowed it. There was a muffled boom\u2014the grenade exploded inside its mouth. Although the tyrant salamander's outer skin was tough, the flesh inside its mouth was soft. The explosion blew its head inside out, the remains falling beneath the rock wall. Its massive body twitched a few times before it lay dead by the riverside rocks, belly-up.\n\nI exhaled deeply, my entire body soaked in cold sweat. I hadn't felt fear during the moment, but now my limbs were weak, and looking down made my head spin.\n\nSuddenly, the mountain wall shook violently. The water in the underground river surged, filling the air with the scent of sulfur, and waves of heat rushed up from below.\n\nThe volcano beneath the riverbed had become active. This unexpected event caught us all by surprise, nearly causing us to fall. We scrambled up a relatively gentle slope and sat down to catch our breath, still shaken. But the underground tremors grew more intense, and the volcanic rock that formed the mountain wall threatened to collapse at any moment.\n\nLuo Ning said that a volcanic eruption wasn't necessarily imminent; it seemed more like a periodic volcanic activity. The duration of these cycles was unpredictable\u2014it could be days or even centuries apart. There are many types of volcanoes. The common ones with inverted trumpet-shaped chimneys are formed after large-scale eruptions. Others, though not extinct, may not have erupted for tens of thousands of years, lying deeply buried underground, occasionally causing tremors.\n\nRegardless of its activity cycle, we were out of luck to have encountered it now. We had intended to follow the underground river to find an exit, but with the water now boiling, descending further would have meant being cooked like dumplings in a pot. It seemed impossible to go down. At a loss for what to do next, Gawa tugged at my clothes and pointed upwards for us to look.\n\nHundreds of meters above our heads, a slender ray of white light appeared. My eyes dazzled, and I felt a sharp pain in them. What could it be? Perhaps it was some long-extinct creature?\n\nLuo Ning was ecstatic: \"It's the sky! It's the sky!\"\n\nThe seismic activity from the underground volcano had caused an earthquake, splitting open a large fissure above us. Having not seen the outside sky for so long, I had almost forgotten what it looked like\u2014whether it was blue or white.\n\n I said to the others, \"Comrades, indeed there is no predicament without an outlet. Perseverance leads to victory. For the sake of New China, let us advance.\"\n\nThe four of us, already exhausted, suddenly saw a glimmer of hope for escape from Birth Sky, and as if out of nowhere, boundless strength surged within us. We stretched our legs and swung our arms, scrambling up the slope with all our might.\n\nThe rumbling below grew more intense, the heatwave oppressive, and the pungent sulfur fumes caused throbbing pain in our foreheads. Fearing that the crack might close again due to the earthquake, everyone wanted to get out as quickly as possible. On the steep 45-degree slope, we exerted ourselves as if sprinting a hundred meters.\n\nThe higher we climbed, the more fragmented the volcanic rock became. Some were as fine as sand, making it hard to find footing. For every three feet we ascended, we slid back two, our hands raw from the friction, but we ignored the pain, gritted our teeth, and clawed our way up. The 500-600 meter ascent was as arduous as the Long March of Ten Thousand Miles across snowy mountains. After expending all our strength, we finally returned to the surface, greeted by the blue sky and white clouds, with mountains stretching on both sides. The spot we had climbed to was a section of the Kunlun River Valley, one of the lowest areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, just a few kilometers from the Non-freezing Spring Military Station at the head of the pass.\n\nLuo Ning was weak, and Gawa had an injured foot; they lagged behind at the critical moment. Without time to rest, the tall man and I linked our Armed Belts into a lifeline and lowered it for Luo Ning and the others to grasp.\n\nThe earthquake grew fiercer, and the crack, more than a meter wide, could collapse at any moment. Luo Ning and Gawa could only cling to the belt, each step sliding back due to the tremors below, unable to advance even half an inch.\n\nThe tall man and I pulled with all our might, but no matter how strong we were, it was impossible to haul them up together. Just then, Gawa released the belt and pushed Luo Ning up from below while we pulled from above, and in one go, we yanked her out of the fissure.\n\nWhen I thought to throw the belt down again to save Gawa, a violent tremor hit, and the earth closed in again, trapping Gawa alive in its midst.\n\nIn the sub-zero temperatures, our coats and hats long gone, the three of us, forgetting the cold and clad only in thin clothes, wept and futilely dug at the earth and stones with our hands and bayonets.\n\nThree days later, I lay in a bed at the Military District Hospital. The Chief of Staff of the Military Region, holding my hand, offered his warm consolation, \"Comrade Little Hu, you have shown great bravery this time. On behalf of the Military Commission, I extend my regards and hope for your swift recovery, that you may achieve new merits on the revolutionary path. How are you feeling now?\"\n\nI replied, \"Thank you for your concern, sir. I am holding up alright.

The harsh environment caused the project progress to lag unexpectedly. Over the course of three years, dozens of combatants sacrificed their lives on the worksite, and yet the military facility we were building had only reached two-thirds completion.\n\nAt this juncture, the global political landscape was reshuffled. Nixon's visit to China in '72 thawed Sino-American relations. China's strategic deployment underwent a massive overhaul, and the construction project within the Kunlun Mountains was halted. We, the combat engineers who had been drafted midway into our careers, were reassigned back to the field army's combat sequence, under the jurisdiction of the Lanzhou Military Region.\n\nDay after day, year after year, the routine of training, drills, exercises, study, and critiques continued. Life in the barracks was not only monotonous but also arduous. A few more years passed, and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. The Central Party Committee timely rectified the chaos, the Gang of Four was smashed, and after a decade of turmoil, social order was finally restored.\n\nHowever, the army was an environment isolated from society, and I hardly felt any significant change within the barracks. The only difference was that we no longer had to recite quotations upon meeting each other, but whenever new recruits arrived, we still had to provide them with revolutionary education.\n\nOne morning, just as I returned from a meeting at the headquarters, the communications officer Little Liu came running up to me, panting: \"Report to the Company Commander, a platoon of new recruits has arrived today. However, the political instructor has gone to the Military Region for training, so please, you must give them a talk on the revolution and our traditions.\"\n\nSpeaking about the revolution and our traditions essentially meant sharing the history of our unit with the new recruits. Admittedly, I was no expert on the subject, but as the company commander and with the political instructor away, I had no choice but to step up to the task.\n\nI led the thirty-odd new recruits into the unit's Honor Display Room and pointed to an embroidered banner that read \"Heroic Bayonet Brigade,\" telling them that this was an honor earned by the predecessors of our Sixth Company during the Huaihai Campaign. This title had been retained to this day. I recounted the fierce battle, embellishing the details of how our Sixth Company had seen red with their bayonets and, despite being out of ammunition and provisions, had used their bayonets to repel a frenzied attack by an entire regiment of Kuomintang reactionaries, gloriously completing the blocking task assigned by our superiors.\n\nThen, pointing to a blackened, broken iron pot in a glass case, I narrated to the new recruits: \"Comrades, don't underestimate this old pot. During the Huaihai Campaign, it was after eating pork and vermicelli stew cooked in this very pot that the revolutionary forebears of our Sixth Company went on to kill enemies and earn merits on the battlefield. Look at the cracks on this pot; they were caused by the reactionary artillery fire of the Kuomintang, and to this day, it silently bears witness to the heroic deeds of the past and the beastly behavior of the reactionaries.\"\n\nThat was about all I could share, as I wasn't professionally responsible for ideological work. Still, I believed I did quite well, enough to hoodwink these new recruits.\n\nAfter dismissing the new recruits to the canteen for their meal, I walked behind them with Little Liu and asked him, \"How was the level of the 'revolution and tradition' talk given by our Company Commander just now?\"\n\n Little Liu exclaimed, \"Wow, Company Commander, you speak so wonderfully that I'm drooling over here. When will our unit study the Revolutionary Martyrs and improve our meals a bit? I'm craving some pork stewed with glass noodles.\"\n\nSwallowing hard, I flicked Little Liu's forehead and scolded him, \"You didn't catch a word about the revolutionary traditions, just fixated on pork and noodles, eh? Hurry up and get to the canteen for food. I heard they're serving buns today, and if you're late, the new recruits will have snatched them all up. I order you, run!\"\n\nWith an affirmative shout, Little Liu strode briskly, charging towards the canteen. Suddenly remembering something crucial I had neglected to tell him, I called out, \"Pick a few with generous fillings for me!\"\n\nLying on my bed, I devoured the buns while perusing the letter that had just arrived from home. Everything was fine, with no mention of anything significant. After reading it twice, I set the letter aside and picked up the worn book passed down through my family. The experiences of the past few years had sparked a profound interest in Feng Shui, and I would study it whenever I had the chance.\n\nThe book was filled with terms like the Five Elements, Eight Trigrams, and Yi Numbers, mentioning things like Eastern Jia Yi Wood, Southern Bing Ding Fire, Central Wu Ji Earth, Western Geng Xin Metal, Northern Ren Gui Water, and trigrams such as Qian, Zhen, Li, Wei, among others. Many parts were puzzling. Over the years, I had gathered various books on the subject and, despite my limited education, managed to grasp about thirty to forty percent of the content.\n\nThe Sixteen-Character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Secret Technique is comprised of the words Man, Buddha, Intimidate, Object, Yang, and Empty.\n\nThe origins of the book, as well as its author, were unknown, but its contents were profound. It spoke of the Sixty-four Changes of Fuxi's Bagua, which should actually be the Sixteen Hexagrams. During the Yin Shang Dynasty, these Sixteen Hexagrams, which were said to reveal the secrets of heaven, were halved by the deities, and even the number of the remaining Eight Trigrams was incomplete. Yet, those who understood even a fraction were considered formidable. Take Zhuge Kongming, who, with some knowledge, was able to protect Liu Bei and strategize for a world in balance. Liu Bowen, who could decipher but a third, helped Zhu Yuanzhang establish the Ming Dynasty's foundation for four hundred years. But such tales of mystic power, I found hard to believe.\n\nMy only regret was that this book contained only the half that discussed the Fengshui Five Elements Tomb Layout Structure. The other half, concerning the Yin Yang Bagua Taiji numbers, had been missing since my grandfather's time. The fragmented text was disjointed and obscure, making it difficult to fathom its deeper meanings. I imagined that a complete version would be much easier to understand.\n\nSuddenly, the air of the military camp was pierced by a series of long and short bugle calls\u2014an emergency assembly. My immediate thought was that something had happened; such a call would not be made without good reason during the daytime. I stuffed the remaining two buns into my mouth, sprang from the bed, and dashed out the door.\n\n Rows upon rows of troops aligned in orderly columns, and I saw that it wasn't just our battalion assembling\u2014our entire regiment was mustering. As a junior officer like myself, I wasn't privy to the details of the operations at hand, my role was simply to obey orders and follow commands. We were instructed to stand by at the train station, ready to deploy alongside the Brother Troops.\n\nOver ten thousand men, a force as imposing as mountains and seas, crowded the Military Train Station. From a distance, the mass of soldiers resembled a tide of green. It seemed the whole division was mobilized\u2014an extraordinary event, as calling an entire division to action was no small feat. Our Main Force Division was a large establishment, comprising three Infantry Regiments, an Artillery Corps, a Tank Regiment, and the Administrative and Logistics Department of the Headquarters, totaling more than twenty thousand personnel. Such a large-scale operation surely wasn't for disaster relief, as I hadn't heard of any disasters in the vicinity recently.\n\nWe were bewilderedly transported in Iron Can Vehicles all the way to the Yunnan Border, where it finally dawned on us that we were heading into battle. At that moment, many broke down in tears.\n\nMeanwhile, Deng Xiaoping, on a visit to the United States, made a startling statement at the White House: \"When children don't listen, they need to be disciplined.\" He openly acknowledged the large-scale troop buildup along the Sino-Vietnamese Border.\n\nThe Dawn Division's two hundred and twenty thousand People's Liberation Army soldiers launched a full-scale offensive, pushing forward to Liang Mountain, after which China announced its withdrawal.\n\nMy unit was the Dagger Company of the Main Force Division, on the Frontline. After ten days of fierce combat, we suffered over fifty percent casualties. During a subsequent march, we fell into an ambush by Vietnamese Special Agents. They used women carrying children as Cover, throwing Dynamite Bags into our Armored Personnel Carriers. Eight of my soldiers were killed inside the armored vehicle. In that moment, my eyes saw red\u2014I killed three and captured two remaining Vietnamese Militia, an old man and a child.\n\nThey were a Vietnamese Old Man in his fifties and a Vietnamese Woman in her twenties, apparently father and daughter. One of my men told me that the woman had disguised the Dynamite Bag as a baby in her arms and threw it into the armored vehicle as she passed by. There was no mistaking it\u2014it was her doing.\n\nWhat I feared most was witnessing my Comrades-in-arms dying before my eyes. In a fit of rage, I completely forgot the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, as well as our military's policy on the treatment of prisoners. I had a Dynamite Bag tied underneath the Vietnamese Woman and made her sit on an Earth Plane. I then bound the old man tightly and threw him from the cliff into a minefield.\n\nThis act was a serious violation of military discipline and even alarmed General Xu at Command Headquarters. Had it not been for my family's deep connections within the Military Region, I would have been court-martialed, and my military career would have been over. With a demobilization order in hand, I returned to my hometown. Book Alliance"

                    "content": "The battle was nearing its end, sporadic gunfire still erupted intermittently, and the battlefield was shrouded in gun smoke. Trenches were chaotically filled with bodies, strewn in every imaginable position.\n\nIn the tunnel, about six or seven remaining Vietnamese soldiers were trapped. I had my men seal off all the exits. Standing at the tunnel's entrance, I shouted into the depths: \"Y\u011b b\u00f9 s\u014dng g\u014dng y\u00e8, s\u014dng ku\u0101n h\u00f3ng d\u00fa b\u012bng n\u00e8i.\"\n\nThe rest of the soldiers joined in: \"Y\u011b b\u00f9 s\u014dng g\u014dng y\u00e8, s\u014dng ku\u0101n h\u00f3ng d\u00fa b\u012bng n\u00e8i.\" In Vietnamese, this meant, \"Lay down your arms, and you will not be harmed; prisoners will be treated well.\" Each frontline combat unit was equipped with a Battlefield Manual, which included phonetic transcriptions in Chinese characters for common Vietnamese phrases such as \"Raise Your Hands\" or \"Don't Move, Hands Up.\" These phrases were used for capturing or persuading the enemy to surrender. Additionally, there were messages intended to propagate our military policies to the Vietnamese civilians. In fact, in the northern regions of Vietnam, where numerous ethnic groups resided, the official Vietnamese language was not as widely spoken as Chinese, and most Vietnamese soldiers were conversant in Mandarin.\n\nThe encircled Vietnamese, from deep within the tunnel, responded with a volley of bullets.\n\nI threw my steel helmet to the ground, cursing: \"Damn their ancestors, they refuse to be captured alive.\" I then turned to the soldiers behind me and commanded: \"Cluster hand grenades, flamethrowers, hit them hard.\" Cluster grenades and flamethrowers were the most effective means against enemies stubbornly resisting inside tunnels and bunkers. We would first suppress them with a barrage of grenades, then proceed to exterminate them with flamethrowers.\n\nBundle after bundle of grenades were hurled into the tunnel, followed by a series of violent explosions. The Chinese soldiers then pressed the flamethrowers against the entrance and unleashed a fierce blaze.\n\nThe air was thick with smoke and the smell of burnt human flesh, making it impossible to keep one's eyes open. I led the way into the tunnel with a submachine gun in hand, eager to see what those little, skinny chicken-like Vietnamese brats had been reduced to.\n\nInside the tunnel, more than a dozen charred Vietnamese bodies lay scattered, indistinguishable whether they had perished from the blasts or the flames.\n\nAt the far end, I found a large bundle of unexploded cluster grenades. I hurriedly led my men to run out, but it was too late. A muffled explosion shook me, and a wave of force knocked me down, plunging my vision into darkness, as if a layer of mud had been smeared over my eyes.\n\nDesperately clawing with my hands, unspeakable panic filled my heart. Then someone grabbed my wrist and said, \"Comrade, wake up. Are you having a nightmare?\"\n\nI opened my eyes to find two train attendants and a carriage full of passengers staring at me, smiles on their faces. Only then did I realize it had all been a dream. I took a deep breath, still shaken by the nightmare.\n\nTo think that I could dream while on a train ride home; I had lost all face. I managed an awkward smile to everyone, probably the ugliest smile of my life. Thankfully, there were no mirrors for me to see my own face.\n\nSeeing that I was awake, a train attendant informed me that we were approaching the final station and that I should prepare to disembark. I nodded, squeezed through to the connection between two carriages, and sat on my luggage. Lighting a cigarette, I took several deep drags, my mind still lingering on my comrades-in-arms at the front.\n\nWearing a uniform without badges or cap emblems felt awkward, and even walking seemed a challenge. How was I to explain this to my father? If the old man found out that I had been sent back by the military, he'd likely take a belt to me.\n\n After about fifteen minutes, I arrived at my stop. I circled around my front door, not daring to enter, and wandered aimlessly through the streets, trying to concoct some far-fetched story to pull the wool over my old man's eyes.\n\nAs dusk fell and twilight embraced the town, I entered a restaurant to grab a bite. The menu prices gave me a start; I hadn't dined out in years, and couldn't believe the cost of food these days\u2014a plate of Yu Xiang Shredded Pork was six yuan! By that reckoning, my demobilization pay of just over three thousand yuan would barely cover five hundred servings of Yu Xiang Shredded Pork.\n\nI ordered two bowls of rice and a plate of Kung Pao Chicken, along with a bottle of beer. The young waitress tried to push some Braised Prawns in Oil on me, but I adamantly refused. Muttering under her breath, she rolled her eyes and huffed away to fetch my order.\n\nI didn't want to stoop to her level. After ten years of military service, sweating blood, facing life and death, my efforts were apparently worth no more than five hundred plates of Yu Xiang Shredded Pork\u2014a thought that was both laughable and somewhat disheartening. Yet, when I considered my comrades who'd sacrificed their lives in the snowy mountains and on the battlefield, what right did I have to feel dissatisfied?\n\nJust then, another customer entered, sporting what appeared to be an imported American-style Large Toad Mirror sunglasses. His trendy attire caught my eye, and I took a longer look.\n\nHe noticed me too, and after sizing me up for a while, he came over and sat opposite me at my table.\n\nI wondered what his deal was, with so many other tables free, why squeeze in with me? Could he be some thug looking to start trouble? It was almost as if he read my mind\u2014I was actually in the mood for a fight. But then, something about him seemed familiar. His face was mostly hidden behind the Large Toad Mirror, and I couldn't quite place him.\n\nPushing his sunglasses down his nose, he spoke, \"Heaven's King Covers the Earth Tiger.\"\n\nThe phrase rang a bell, and I automatically responded, \"Pagoda Suppresses River Monster.\"\n\nHe asked, \"Why's your face red?\"\n\nI shot back, giving a Big Thumb up, \"Anxious from not finding a wife.\"\n\n\"And why's it turned white now?\"\n\n\"Scared pale by a shrewish wife.\"\n\nWe embraced each other, laughing. \"Little Fatty, bet you didn't expect the Central Red Army to return, huh?\"\n\nFatty, nearly in tears with emotion, exclaimed, \"Old Hu, our various Red Army factions have finally rendezvoused in Shaanbei once again.\"\n\nWe'd exchanged letters over the years, but the vast distance had kept us from meeting face to face. It was an incredible coincidence to run into each other in a restaurant upon my return to the city.\n\nFatty's father had held a higher rank than my own dad, but unfortunately, he didn't survive the Cultural Revolution, meeting his end in a Cowshed. A few years after Fatty's Return to City, he landed a job but got into a fight with his boss. Not long after, he started his own gig as a Self-employed Household, trafficking popular Cassette Tapes of songs to the north from our area.\n\nWe hadn't seen each other in years, and as we drank, our faces flushed and voices grew loud, I completely forgot about the lies I had intended to fabricate. When I got home, truth spilled out in my drunken state, and I told my father everything. To my surprise, he wasn't angry but rather pleased. I thought to myself, the older this old man gets, the lower his consciousness seems to fall, happy that his son no longer had to go to the front lines.\n\n The job that the Reconversion Office had arranged for me was a position at a Food Factory as the Deputy Chief of Security Department. Having spent too much time in the military, I had no desire to return to the routine life of clocking in and out, so I didn't take it. Instead, I teamed up with Fatty to venture into business in the north.\n\nTime flew swiftly, and before we knew it, the Eighties had arrived. We were both well into our thirties, yet our business was growing increasingly bleak. Far from saving up for marriage, we were struggling just to feed ourselves, often having to ask our families for money to deal with urgent needs. According to the Third Plenary Session, the whole country had basically solved the problem of food and clothing, but it seemed to me that we were still living in times predating liberation\u2014oppressed, exploited, and unable to satisfy our basic needs.\n\nOn this particular day, the weather was splendid, the sky clear for miles. Each of us sporting a pair of sunglasses and dressed in bell-bottoms, we pushed a tricycle down the streets of Beijing. On it, we mounted a board laden with cassette tapes, and with a battered tape recorder connected to two worn-out speakers, we blared Taiwanese pop songs of the time.\n\nA bespectacled female student approached us, browsed for a while, and asked, \"Do you have any tapes by Wang Jieshi and Xie Lisi?\"\n\nWe used to stock those, but they had sold out two days earlier. Fatty, with a grin, responded to her, \"Oh, my dear sister, what era are you living in that you're still listening to their songs? Have you heard of Teresa Teng, Qian Baihui, or Zhang Aijia? Take a few tapes to listen to at home, they're as delightful as can be.\"\n\nThe female student, sensing that Fatty was not the most reputable of fellows, turned and walked away.\n\nFatty couldn't help but mutter a string of curses in frustration: \"What a fool, putting on airs like that. She still wants to listen to Golden Shuttle and Silver Shuttle, yet she looks as plain as a shuttle herself.\"\n\nI chided him, \"Why have you started speaking with a Beijing Accent now? Isn't speaking Mandarin well enough? Pretending to be someone you're not. Doing business in Beijing has become too difficult; let's head to Xi'an in a few days.\"\n\nFatty was about to defend his lineage, claiming his ancestors hailed from Beijing, but before he could finish, he suddenly pointed towards one end of the street and shouted, \"Industry and Commerce are raiding, run!\"\n\nWe pushed our tricycle and bolted, zigzagging through the streets until we unwittingly found ourselves in Panjiayuan Antique Market.\n\nThe street was lined with vendors dealing in all things vintage, from Old Emblems and Red Treasure Books that collectors sought, to an assortment of bottles, old clocks, Old Pocket Watches, and Embroidered Shoes once worn by women with Three-inch Golden Lotuses. Piles of old coins, Snuff Bottles, various Antique Furniture, Pipes, calligraphy and paintings, Carved Research Desks, Inks, Brushes, and Yellow Papers, old Pipes, cricket jars, porcelain, Lacquerware, and an array of gold and jade ornaments\u2014if it was old, it was likely to be found here."

                    "content": "Fatty possessed a family heirloom, a jade pendant that he always carried with him. This piece of jade was a gift from a commander of the Northwestern Field Army to his father. Back in the day, the commander led his troops into Xinjiang and eradicated a gang of bandits in the Niya Oasis. The jade had been on the person of one of the bandits. Though it was referred to as a jade pendant, its shape was hardly typical\u2014its design was ancient and peculiar, engraved with a mishmash of patterns that resembled both a map and inscriptions, its true purpose unknown.\n\nI had seen this jade numerous times, as my family had a collection of antiques, and I grew up listening to my grandfather share his extensive knowledge of gold. However, the age and value of this particular piece of jade eluded me.\n\nFatty had thought to sell the jade to raise some capital for business, but I stopped him. \"This is a legacy from your father; don't sell it unless you absolutely must. We're not yet at our wit's end. If it really comes down to it, I can ask my family for money. After all, my grandparents have had their pensions nicely topped up.\"\n\nWe spotted an empty space by the roadside and parked our tricycle there, then bought two bowls of braised stuffed buns for lunch.\n\nBraised stuffed buns consisted of a broth made from pig offal, filled with things like intestines and soaked with chopped-up baked wheaten cake. At a little over one yuan per bowl, it was both economical and filling.\n\nI had added too much chili to my bowl, and it was so spicy that I was in tears, panting and sticking out my tongue.\n\nAfter taking a couple of bites, Fatty said to me, \"Old Hu, I had hoped to lead you to fortune these past few years, but now the national economy is thriving. The situation isn't just a little good\u2014it's excellent. It's nothing like when I first started peddling, when there were only three places in all of Beijing selling pop music cassette tapes. I feel like I've dragged you down. Your father was a division commander before he retired and enjoys the benefits of a deputy municipal-level official. You might as well go back and have your old man pull some strings to get you a job in a government agency. There's no need for you to suffer with me.\"\n\nI patted Fatty's belly and replied, \"Brother, let me tell you something from the heart. If I really wanted a government agency job, I could get one at any time. But I'm afraid to. Do you know why? If I sit still in one place, I can't think of anything else\u2014all I see are my deceased comrades-in-arms, haunting me. The sight of them nearly tears my guts apart. At least when we're running around busily with our small business, I can distract myself with other thoughts. Otherwise, I'd go mad.\"\n\nHaving spent so many years in the military, if I hadn't learned anything else, I had learned how to boost morale. I comforted Fatty, \"We're not doing too badly now. Aren't we still able to enjoy braised buns? Just think back to the days in the Kunlun Mountains\u2014that was real hardship. One Spring Festival, everyone was homesick, and many of the new recruits were crying in secret. The division commander couldn't stand for that and quickly arranged for everyone to make dumplings to improve the meal. You wouldn't believe what those dumplings were like. There were no vegetables in the Kunlun Mountains; they were more expensive than gold. We had plenty of meat, though, so the dumplings were all meat-filled. The altitude was so high that water wouldn't boil, and the dumplings came out half-cooked, with the meat inside still red. Can you imagine the taste? Despite that, I gobbled down seventy or eighty of them\u2014I was so starved for cooked food, I almost burst. The next day, I had to be taken to the hospital; my stomach felt like it was lined with sheet metal. Do you remember what they said in 'Red Cliff'? 'The night before the revolution triumphs is the coldest.' Our business won't always be like this. If cassette tapes don't sell, we can sell something else. Just as the old man said, 'If Mount Lu is closed to us, then we'll climb the Jinggang Mountains. If the People's Liberation Army won't join me, I'll find the Red Army.'\"\n\n I turned on the tape recorder, and instantly, the two loudspeakers began to emit music.\n\nDue to the shabby condition of the recorder, the sound quality was terrible. Even the most beautiful songs played through it sounded like a broken gong.\n\nBut Fatty and I didn't find it unpleasant; it was, after all, better than either of us could sing. After my thorough and simple ideological education, Fatty's spirits had lifted, and he began to sway his legs to the rhythm of the music, belting out his sales pitch: \"Come take a look, see for yourself, Hong Kong and Taiwan original versions, slashing arms and legs in a clearance sale, selling at a loss to earn a 'Yo He'!\"\n\nPassersby and the neighboring vendors cast curious glances our way. There was a man selling antiques on a street stall nearby. He came over to greet us with a smile, revealing a big gold tooth. The man with the Big Gold Tooth pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered us a round.\n\nTaking a cigarette, I noted: \"Not bad at all, American cigarettes, Marlboro.\"\n\nAs Big Gold Tooth lit my cigarette, he said, \"Gentlemen, selling pop songs at the Panjiayuan Flea Market, I bet no third person in this Four Nine City (Beijing) could've thought of that. You two are really something else.\"\n\nI took a deep drag of the cigarette and exhaled two streams of white smoke through my nose. These American cigarettes really packed a punch. I looked up at Big Gold Tooth and said, \"Don't tease us with that. We're just here to avoid the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. We'll leave after a short rest.\"\n\nAs it turned out, we weren't strangers after all. Big Gold Tooth was from Hainan Island, had been sent down to Yunnan in the past, and his father's generation had settled there during the People's Liberation Army's southern campaign. His family roots were all in the 'Three Wildernesses', and once you start talking about where your hometown is, which column and which unit of the army your elders belonged to, you find the connections aren't so distant.\n\n Big Gold Tooth's father wasn't any sort of official; he was a folk craftsman of grave robbing who was later conscripted during the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, which is also known as the Huaihai Campaign. His unit defected and joined the People's Liberation Army, where he served as a cook. On the Korean battlefield, he suffered frostbite that left him permanently paralyzed. After the Reform and Opening-up, he moved from Hainan to Beijing and started a small business dealing in antique collectibles.\n\nTalking is not as good as listening. He might dress it up with fancy terms like \"craftsman of grave robbing,\" but isn't that just a euphemism for a grave-digging thief? Others might not catch on, but I was raised by my grandfather who often spoke of such matters.\n\nAn expert needs only to extend a hand to know what's there. Digging deeper, I asked Big Gold Tooth, \"Did your old man ever unearth any significant 'zongzi' during his tomb raiding days?\" The term 'zongzi' is a bit of covert lingo among tomb raiders, similar to how mountain bandits wouldn't outright admit to murder and arson but have their own slang or jargon. Here, a 'zongzi' refers to a corpse that is well-preserved and not decayed. Encountering a 'big zongzi' suggests running into trouble, like zombies or malevolent spirits. A 'dry zongzi' means the corpse has decayed to nothing but bones, while a 'meaty zongzi' indicates a body that still has valuable items on it.\n\nAt the mention of this, Big Gold Tooth immediately treated me with newfound respect and insisted on inviting Fatty and me to Dongsi for a mutton hot pot, with the intention of discussing further. So, the three of us gathered our things and set off for Dongsi together."

                    "name": "Chapter 16: Big Gold Tooth",
                    "content": "In a hotpot restaurant in Dongsi, Beijing, every table was occupied by diners, with steam from the bubbling pots filling the air. The sounds of the drinking game \"Push Cup and Change Goblet,\" along with the merry cries of \"One Five Drink Six,\" were ceaseless.\n\nWe found an empty table in a corner and sat down. Big Gold Tooth kept pouring me drinks, and I thought to myself that this fellow was probably trying to get me drunk to pry some secrets from me. So, I quickly stopped him, \"Lord Jin, this Erguotou packs quite a punch. I'm a lightweight; I think I'll stick to beer.\"\n\nAs we ate and chatted, the conversation turned to the topic of grave robbing. Big Gold Tooth, flashing a grin that showcased his namesake, tapped his gold tooth and said to us, \"Gentlemen, feast your eyes on this. I acquired this gold tooth at Panjiayuan. It was dug up from a grave, a Pre-Ming Buddha Lang Gold, plucked right out of the mouth of a rice dumpling. I couldn't bear to sell it, so I had my own tooth pulled and replaced it with this one.\"\n\nIt was quite something, discussing such matters over dinner, almost enough to put one off their food. If he was too stingy to spend money, why not just say so? The more I thought about what he said, the more disgusted I felt, so I quickly steered the conversation to other topics.\n\nWe chatted about various things, from the tricks of the trade in feng shui tomb assessments to the days spent as an engineer soldier on the Kunlun Mountains. Big Gold Tooth listened with such amazement that he couldn't help but express his utmost admiration for me.\n\nBig Gold Tooth's father, before being conscripted by the Kuomintang, had apprenticed with a master grave robber from Hunan, surnamed Cai, and knew a great deal about the craft. However, he never learned the skills of locating graves, as his master, Mr. Cai, was not versed in the art of feng shui. It wasn't until after the twelfth year of the Republic of China that Farmer Li from Luoyang devised the Luoyang Shovel. Before its popularity, their faction relied mainly on their sense of smell, and to maintain the sensitivity of their noses, they abstained from tobacco, alcohol, and spicy foods.\n\nThey would drive an iron drill into the ground and then smell it upon extraction. The various scents that the iron drill brought up from the earth, along with the tactile feedback when drilling\u2014whether the ground was hollow, or if there was wood, brick, or stone\u2014these sensations were unmistakably different.\n\nIn essence, this method was not too dissimilar from using a Luoyang Shovel; the difference lay in using the nose instead of the eyes. The soil brought up by the Luoyang Shovel could be examined to determine the composition of the soil beneath. The presence of porcelain shards, wood fragments, cloth, mercury, lead, as well as rammed earth and bricks, were all indicators of a grave below. These clues could be used to deduce the era and structure of an underground ancient tomb.\n\n However, the craft of Wen Tu was lost when it reached Big Gold Tooth. His father was disabled in both legs, and he himself suffered from congenital asthma since childhood, so he gave up the tomb raiding business. Those who are in this line of work usually have seen their fair share of genuine artifacts and, with that bit of discernment, they start dealing in antiques.\n\nI joked that his ancestral skills were rather trendy. I mentioned that I had heard from my elders about grave robbing. The real masters never used iron drills or Luoyang shovels; those were considered crude methods. A skilled individual could arrive at a site, take one look, and know whether there was an ancient tomb underground, its exact location, and its structure\u2014all at a glance. Wherever the feng shui was exceptional, there was bound to be a large tomb. Those interred within were no ordinary people during their lifetimes, and such tombs were filled with treasures. A true expert would disdain the use of a Luoyang shovel, for if the soil wasn't dry enough, its effectiveness would be greatly reduced. Especially in the wealthy regions of the south, where rainfall is abundant and many ancient tombs are submerged by groundwater, the soil layers are thoroughly disrupted.\n\nBig Gold Tooth was dazzled by my elaborate talk and held me in even higher esteem. \"Master Hu, I am truly convinced. How does the saying go? 'Hearing the Way in the morning, one can die content in the evening.' After listening to your profound insights, I feel my life has not been lived in vain. To encounter someone like you, who understands both feng shui and has been an engineer soldier, with knowledge of civil engineering operations, is truly rare. It would be a pity for someone with your talents not to be a tomb raider.\"\n\nI shook my head and said, \"I have no intention of engaging in such immoral activities. What I've just told you are stories I heard from my grandfather, who was a tomb raider in his day. He once encountered a huge 'zongzi' (a euphemism for a dangerous encounter in a tomb) and nearly lost his life.\"\n\nBig Gold Tooth acknowledged that the risks were indeed real, but with a few black donkey hooves, one need not fear. Moreover, as the saying goes, \"Even thieves have principles.\" The reputation of grave robbing is tarnished, but that's due to some despicable petty thieves who aren't really from the trade. They have no understanding of the rules and wreak havoc wherever they go, which naturally incites hatred. If we were to trace the history of grave robbing, it would span over three thousand years. During the era of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao had a special unit under his command tasked with excavating ancient tombs for military provisions, which is how we came to have the term \"tomb raider.\"\n\n Before liberation, the trade was divided into four schools of thought: east, south, west, and north. By the eighties, the talent had withered away, leaving only a few remaining practitioners, and even they had washed their hands in a golden basin, retiring from the trade. The younger generation now consists of idle country folk who band together to dig up graves and plunder tombs, completely ignorant of the professional ethics, the two taboos, and the ritual of three incenses and three bows. Much of the good stuff has been destroyed by their hands.\n\nBig Gold Tooth sighed for a while, then turned to us and said, \"I've been dealing in Panjiayuan for many years. If you two ever come across any treasures, I can help you find buyers. You handle the negotiations, and if a deal is struck, just give me a small commission.\"\n\nFatty, who had been preoccupied with eating and drinking, was nearly full when he suddenly remembered something. He took out a piece of jade he had on him and asked Big Gold Tooth to appraise it, to see how much it might be worth.\n\nBig Gold Tooth examined it, sniffed it a few times, and said, \"Fat Master, this is a fine piece of jade, at least a thousand years old, perhaps even dating back to before the Tang Dynasty. The script on it isn't Chinese\u2014I can't make out what it is\u2014but it's definitely valuable. However, I'd advise you not to sell it until its true value is ascertained; otherwise, you might suffer a great loss. Where did you come by this jade?\"\n\nFatty, invigorated by the topic of his family history, began, \"The origin is a long tale, akin to a child without a mother. To put it simply, this jade was given to my father by an old comrade-in-arms who participated in the Huangma Uprising. My father's comrade was the foremost senior officer in the field. When his troops entered Xinjiang, they encountered a gang of bandits. Those bandits were courting death; the guard corps from the People's Liberation Army's top leader is not to be trifled with. In less than five or six minutes, they had wiped out over a hundred bandits. When they were cleaning up the battlefield, they found this jade on the leader of the bandits. The top leader gifted it to my father as a memento. As for the history of the jade before that, I have no idea.\"\n\nWe continued drinking until past midnight before parting ways. As we said our farewells, Big Gold Tooth gave each of us a hook-shaped object. It was over an inch long, jet black and shiny, exceedingly hard, and bore two characters in seal script that looked like 'touch gold.' It appeared to be an ancient artifact, with one end drilled and strung with a red silk thread, suitable to be worn as a pendant. Big Gold Tooth said, \"It's like we've been brothers from the first meeting. These amulets are made from pangolin claws. They're for you to keep as a memento. Come find me in Panjiayuan whenever you're free. As the green hills remain and the clear waters flow, we shall meet again.\""

                    "name": "Chapter 17: The Plan",
                    "content": "Fatty and I returned to the small flat we rented near Chongwenmen, drunk to the point of stupor, and slept straight through to the next afternoon.\n\nUpon waking, as I lay in bed gazing at the low, squat ceiling, my thoughts were many. The trade of tomb raiding wasn't unfamiliar to me\u2014I was confident in my ability to locate some grand mausoleums. Money wasn't of utmost importance to me; one could even say I couldn't care less about it. Yet life is full of contradictions, and now, I found myself in dire need of it.\n\nMy parents were state-supported; I had no familial burdens to shoulder. If I was fed, the whole family was content. But what of my brothers who had fallen on the battlefield? Who would care for their parents, cover the costs of their medical care and medications, or pay for their younger siblings' education? The meager consolation money they received was hardly enough to fend off the biting northwest winds.\n\nOn the battlefield, it seemed everyone had a reason they absolutely couldn't die\u2014everyone except me. Yet, I was the survivor. My life was bought at the price of many comrades-in-arms. It was time I did something for them.\n\nFatty woke up too, rubbing his eyes. Seeing me staring blankly at the ceiling, he said, \"Old Hu, I know what you're thinking without you saying it. The words of Big Gold Tooth yesterday stirred your heart, didn't they? I'm itching to act too. Just waiting on your word, brother.\"\n\nI took out the amulet Big Gold Tooth had given us. \"Don't regard that grandson as any sort of saint,\" I told Fatty. \"He's in business for profit, up with the sun for a reason. This digging claw dates back to the time of Cao Cao, a warlord of the Three Kingdoms, worn by his tomb raiders. He wouldn't just gift us something so valuable without motive\u2014he's seen our potential and wants a slice of the pie.\"\n\nFatty became agitated. \"I knew he wasn't a good egg. I'll go to Panjiayuan later, rip out his big gold tooth and toss it into the outhouse.\"\n\nDespite saying this, we both agreed that it might be wise to use each other to our mutual advantage, at least for the time being. A flaw in my character was impulsiveness, not thoroughly considering consequences. I felt the path of tomb raiding was viable, believing that everything in the world has two sides\u2014a good deed could turn bad, and a bad deed could turn good. This was the dialectical method.\n\nThe tombs of emperors and generals were filled with countless treasures, but could one truly say these fine things belonged to the tomb masters? Weren't they all plundered from the common people? Appropriated from the populace, they should rightfully be used for the people's benefit. How could we let them eternally accompany dry bones sleeping underground? If one were to act, act grandly. The commoners' graves held little interest, mostly devoid of valuables, and taking from the people would damage one's yin virtue.\n\nI remember my grandfather speaking of the rules of tomb raiders, quite distinct from those of common grave thieves. Grave thieves dug and grabbed without rhyme or reason, their deeds absolute, indifferent to whether the tombs belonged to loyal ministers, valiant generals, officials, or commoners. They had no rules to speak of, and what little they had were cobbled together by the peasants themselves, not amounting to much at all.\n\n Tomb raiders at work would always light a candle and place it in the southeast corner whenever they opened a large tomb and entered its underground chamber. Then, they would begin their task, prying open the coffin to seek treasure. The most valuable possessions of the deceased were often found on their person. Notably, those of princes and nobles, the masters of these tombs, were adorned with pearls in their mouths, bodies draped in gold and jade, with heart-protecting jade on their chests, and even their hands clutching jade Ruyi scepters. Some were so extravagant that even their anal cavities were stuffed with precious stones. At such a time, one must proceed without damaging the remains, gently feeling from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet, leaving behind one or two treasures for the deceased. During this process, if the candle in the southeast corner were to extinguish, one must return the acquired wealth to its original place, bow respectfully three times, and retreat along the same path they came.\n\nThe reason some ghosts are said to linger in these tombs, not entering into reincarnation for hundreds of years, remains a mystery. It is likely that they cannot part with the glory and riches of their former lives, watching over their treasures day after day. When one encounters such spirits, more attached to their wealth than to life itself, it is better not to forcefully rob them of their possessions.\n\nUltimately, Fatty and I decided, to hell with it, we would become full-fledged tomb raiders. As for any pangs of conscience, let's say our conscience was half-eaten by a dog. Or rather, let's view it from another perspective. It's the eighties now, isn't it? Isn't devotion being advocated? It's about time those princes and nobles who exploited the working people made their contribution. But these dead souls are not so enlightened; don't expect them to come forth and offer their treasures willingly. That's where we come in, to shake down these feudal overlords, to sweep up their golden pots and divide their fields and lands. We're truly busy with this task.\n\nHaving set our strategic direction, we still needed to carefully plan the specific tactical objectives and their implementation.\n\nIn the provinces of Henan, Hunan, and Shaanxi, where tomb raiding was most rampant, large tombs had become hard to find. Moreover, it was inconvenient to operate in crowded places, and one had to cover their activities with farming or building houses. The best option would be to head for the deep mountains and old forests, where few people ventured.\n\nSpeaking of large tombs I've encountered in deep mountains and old forests, the one on Ox Heart Mountain undoubtedly tops the list. I was too young and ignorant when I was sent \"Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside,\" but judging with my current experience, that tomb must date from before the Northern Song Dynasty, likely from the flourishing Tang Dynasty period. It was fashionable then to use mountains as mausoleums, a trend that continued into the early Song Dynasty. After the Southern Song Dynasty, as the nation's power waned, no royal mausoleum dared to undertake such grand construction projects again.\n\n Fatty asked me, \"Didn't you say that Ox Heart Mountain was haunted? Can't we find a place that isn't haunted to do our thing? We can handle the Bear Wild Man just fine, but if we come across ghosts, I wouldn't know how to deal with them.\"\n\nI told him, firstly, there are no such things as ghosts in this world. What I told you last time might have been a hallucination of mine. Secondly, this is our first operation, and it's not absolutely necessary to start excavating mountains. Do you remember how many families in the village have antiques? Let's go collect a few and sell them. That would save us the trouble and effort.\n\nThat very day, we each prepared separately. Fatty went to dispose of the remaining cassette tapes, while I headed to the second-hand market to buy some essential tools: a flashlight, gloves, a face mask, candles, rope, a water bottle. What thrilled me the most was finding two German-made sapper's shovels. Holding the engineer soldier's shovel in my hand felt like meeting an old friend.\n\nThis type of engineer soldier's shovel was equipped by the German Mountain Assault Division during World War II. Many were seized by the Soviets, and during the period of Sino-Soviet Friendship, some made their way into Chinese territory. The German-made sapper's shovel is very portable, foldable to be hung at the waist, and the steel edge is superb. Not to mention digging through soil and rock, in times of danger, it can also be wielded as a weapon, capable of chopping off half an enemy's head with a single swing.\n\nThe only regret was not being able to buy a gas mask. During the nationwide civil defense efforts, many Model 60 gas masks were distributed among the populace, and they occasionally appear in the antique market. Unfortunately, I had no luck finding one today and had to leave it for another time. There were also a few other items missing, but those could wait until we reached Ganggang Camp.\n\nIn total, I spent over fifteen hundred, mainly because those two shovels were expensive\u2014at six hundred apiece, the price was firm and wouldn't budge. In the end, I was left with only six yuan in my pocket, which was problematic\u2014I didn't have enough money to buy a train ticket.\n\nThankfully, Fatty had managed to sell off the cassette tapes and had also terminated the lease on our rented room and sold the tricycle, which just about covered our round-trip expenses. We bought train tickets overnight. I was not yet eighteen when I left that place, and it had been over a decade since I'd been back. The thought of seeing the villagers I hadn't seen in so many years excited both of us."

                    "name": "Chapter 18: Black Wind Pass Wildman Gully",
                    "content": "Our train was scheduled for the next afternoon at two o'clock, and in our excitement, we spent a sleepless night. I asked Fatty how much money we had left. After counting, Fatty said there was only one hundred and fifty left\u2014barely enough to cover our travel expenses and meals.\n\nI thought to myself, that won't do. We haven't been home in over a decade. It would be highly inappropriate to show up empty-handed to see our folks. We needed to find a way to scrounge up some money to buy gifts for them.\n\nFatty suggested, \"Why not sell this jade piece of mine for a good eight or nine hundred?\"\n\nI told him, \"Better keep it. Don't always think about pawning off the few things your dad left you. Once sold, you can't get them back, and you might end up regretting it bitterly.\"\n\nIn the end, I dug out something of value. We had an Eagle Song brand mechanical watch, a limited edition piece given to me by my dad when I became a company commander. It was so rare that even money might not buy it, and it could fetch over two hundred on the market. I went to Panjiayuan and sold the watch to Big Gold Tooth, a guy who'd buy anything. When he heard we were heading to Inner Mongolia to try our luck, he even sponsored us with an extra hundred, agreeing to help us find buyers for whatever we might find.\n\nBack in the eighties, three hundred yuan was enough for an ordinary family to live luxuriously for two or three months\u2014it was a considerable sum. With this money, I bought plenty of food items\u2014preserved fruits, milk candies, canned goods, chocolates, tea leaves\u2014delicacies you couldn't find in the mountains. The remaining cash I exchanged entirely for national Food Ration Tickets on the black market.\n\nThe two-day-and-night journey felt long, filled with anticipation. After arriving at the station, there was still a day's tractor ride, followed by another day and night of trekking into the mountains.\n\nBarely a day into the mountains, Fatty and I could go no further. The burden was too heavy; each of us was carrying over a hundred pounds. I gritted my teeth and pressed on, but Fatty was truly spent. He sat under a big tree, gasping for air, unable to utter a word.\n\nThankfully, we ran into an accountant coming out of the village for business. Back when we joined the commune, he was just a kid, always trailing behind us and calling us 'brother.' Seeing our heavy luggage, he hurried back to the village and brought back a few folks with donkeys to help us. Among them were some elders we recognized, and two girls around twelve or thirteen, born after I had left. They awkwardly called me 'uncle.'\n\nI asked the accountant, \"Why aren't there any young men in the village?\"\n\nHe explained, \"All the able-bodied men from the village have gone to work with the Archaeological Team. Remember the Tangshan earthquake in '76? Though it happened far from here, we're on the same earthquake belt. That quake cracked open Ox Heart Mountain in Lama Gully, revealing a palace-like large tomb inside. Many of the braver souls from our village went in to grab what they could. There were treasures aplenty. Somehow, the county government got wind of it, and the Archaeological Team arrived soon after. They claimed it was the mausoleum of Empress Dowager Xiao of the Liao dynasty, and they confiscated all the valuable items from our homes, not leaving a single piece behind. Since then, the Archaeological Team hasn't done much with Ox Heart Mountain, saying there's still much more to unearth beneath it. They've hired all our village laborers, providing food and lodging, plus three yuan a day. It's been several years and the work still isn't finished. Many are still employed there.\"\n\n Fatty and I nearly choked on our own blood when we heard these words. The audacity to think they could outmaneuver us at our own game, as if even the Buddha himself would fall from grace.\n\nBut there was little we could do. It wasn't as if we could just go and wrestle with the Archaeological Team or the Cultural Relics Bureau for their turf. Since we were here, we might as well enjoy ourselves for a few days before finding another spot. After all, it's not like Ox Heart Mountain was the only ancient tomb around.\n\nAs we approached the village, the news of our arrival had already reached the villagers who were waiting at their doorsteps. They crowded around us, firing questions, as Yanzi, leading her daughter by the hand, cried and said to us, \"Oh, Old Hu and Fatty, we've missed you so much. Why haven't we heard from you in all these years?\" Yanzi's father hugged us both tightly, \"You two rascals, vanishing without a trace. This time, you're not leaving unless you stay for at least two or three years. No one's allowed to leave.\"\n\nFatty and I were both moved to tears. Fatty had lived here for six or seven years, and I for one, but the mountain folk were sincere. Once you've lived among them, they treat you as one of their own forever. Everything was just as it had been before, unchanged. There was no electricity, no roads. Many here had never seen an electric light in their lives. The more I thought about it, the sadder I felt. I resolved that once I had the money, I would definitely build a road for the villagers. But when would we ever have that kind of money?\n\nAt that moment, the village's old Branch Secretary, supported by others, made his way toward us. Before he even reached us, he called out loudly, \"The Chairman's children have returned! How is the Chairman doing now? How did he fare during the Cultural Revolution?\"\n\nI was puzzled by his words. How would I know how the Chairman was doing? I hurried forward to support the old Branch Secretary's arm and said, \"He's resting well, lying in the mausoleum every day. Anyone who misses him can buy a ticket to go see him. The Cultural Revolution has long ended. Now, Comrade Xiaoping is leading us all in the Reform and Opening-up.\"\n\nIt seemed as though the old Branch Secretary hadn't heard a word I said. He craned his neck and shouted, \"Comrade Ming, what is he up to?\"\n\nYanzi whispered to me, \"Don't mind what he says. Who knows what he's getting at. He's been deaf since '73 and can't hear much. Plus, he's always a bit confused.\"\n\nThen it dawned on me, and I leaned in close to the Branch Secretary's ear and said loudly, \"Branch Secretary, I've brought you lots of tasty treats. I'll bring them over to you in a bit. Take your time and enjoy them.\"\n\n As they talked, the group entered the village. The old Branch Secretary was still shouting from behind: \"Children, when you return, report to the elder that we resolutely support the Proletarian Cultural Revolution and will follow through with whatever is required.\"\n\nThat evening, the table on Yanzi's kang, a traditional Chinese bed-stove, was laden with stir-fried pheasant slices and smoked deer leg, with a large clay pot in the center simmering sour cabbage and white meat. Yanzi's husband, who was well acquainted with us, hadn't returned from working in Ox Heart Mountain, so we couldn't meet him for the time being.\n\nWhile drinking with us, Yanzi's father joined in the conversation. I brought up the matter of the ancient tomb at Ox Heart Mountain and casually inquired if there were any more tombs of ancient nobility hidden within these great mountains.\n\nFor ages, the mountain folk had seen tomb raiding as a way to supplement their income, with no moral qualms. It was the same in the north; in the southern regions of Xiangxi, robbery and murder were treated as a side business. The mountain people would farm by day and turn bandit by night, hiding in the woods and exclusively targeting foreign merchants passing through, leaving no survivors. This was a survival tactic honed over thousands of years, living off the land and water. In areas of poverty and harsh terrain, ancient tombs and passing travelers became their sustenance. If there was a tomb nearby, there would surely be someone to unearth it. In these remote areas, where the emperor's reach was weak and the law held little sway, such practices were commonplace, even if they couldn't be justified legally. Most of the ancient tombs nearby were too old, their markers lost to the changing landscape; otherwise, the locals would have plundered them long ago.\n\nYanzi's father recounted that before liberation, there were a few young amateur tomb raiders in the village. At that time, they were unaware of the tomb at Ox Heart Mountain and set out for a fabled place rumored to have gold-filled graves. Whatever they encountered remains unknown, as none returned, including Yanzi's second uncle. Yanzi's father knew the approximate location of this legendary site but had never dared to venture there himself.\n\nAs the old man delved into the past, he lit his Yabuli pipe and took a few pensive puffs. After a long silence, he spoke: \"If you're seeking ancient tombs, there are none nearby other than at Ox Heart Mountain. According to old tales, if you head north from here through Tuanshanzi and into the mountains for a five-day journey, you'll reach Black Wind Pass at the Sino-Mongolian Border. There lies Wildman Gully, which is said to be filled with the graves of princes and nobles, rich with gold. However, that place is seldom visited by humans and is rumored to be haunted by wild men. Do you have the courage to go?\"\n\nI had heard of Wildman Gully before, but not of any tombs there. What exactly had befallen the last group of tomb raiders, no one knew\u2014not me, not Yanzi's father, and not anyone else in the village.\n\n Deep in the mountain forest, dangers abound\u2014feral beasts of all kinds, and even the capricious weather and natural environment can claim a person's life. Should one encounter an opium den and be engulfed within, even the most divine immortals could not escape.\n\nOur resolve to go was firm, and not even Swallow's father could dissuade us. No one in the village had truly ventured to Black Wind Pass or Wildman Gully; we only knew their approximate locations. Since these places were near the border and devoid of human habitation, the villagers, even those who went hunting or foraging in the mountains, never ventured so far. Moreover, Swallow's father was advanced in years and suffered from chronic leg pain, which prevented him from entering the mountains. Swallow herself was pregnant with her second child and couldn't travel far. The young and able-bodied men of the village were all working in Lama Gully and wouldn't return for some time.\n\nSwallow's father said, \"I'll always be worried if I don't lead you there myself. The danger in Wildman Gully doesn't come from any wild man; it's the complex terrain that's the real threat. Come winter, the fierce blizzards make it easy to lose one's way. But now, in early autumn, that's not a concern. If you must go, be sure to take plenty of dogs and find a reliable guide. Our village has raised several Tibetan Mastiffs in recent years, and you should take them with you.\"\n\nThe term 'mastiff' does not refer solely to the Tibetan Mastiff; in the northeast, any large and ferocious dog is called a Tibetan Mastiff, which is not exactly the same as the ones from Tibet.\n\nHunters and herders living in the northern grasslands and forests, threatened by wolves and black bears, find ordinary hunting dogs insufficient. They have adopted the Tibetan method of raising mastiffs to breed Tibetan Mastiffs. There's a saying: \"nine dogs, one mastiff,\" which doesn't mean that out of nine dogs, one will be a mastiff. It requires a female of excellent lineage to give birth to a litter of nine puppies, which are then confined to a pit from birth, without food or drink, left to fight each other. The sole survivor, tempered by this brutal selection, is deemed a mastiff. With a nature fiercely aggressive, three Tibetan Mastiffs are capable of tearing a strong human bear to shreds.\n\nOur village had a total of three mastiffs, and along with five of the finest hunting dogs, they were all entrusted to us. Swallow's father also recommended a guide to us, Yingzi.\n\nAt just nineteen, Yingzi, a rare member of the Oroqen ethnicity within the village, was an exceptional hunter among the younger generation. Known throughout the great mountains as a sharpshooter, her youth belied her experience; she had hunted in the forest with her father since she was a child. There was nothing about the Old Forest she didn't know, and of the village's three Tibetan Mastiffs, two were raised by her own hand.\n\n Before setting out, I had Yanzi help me prepare a few things: a birdcage, glutinous rice, black donkey hoof, a crowbar, a large barrel of vinegar, and some strong liquor.\n\nOnce everything was packed and ready, Yanzi\u2019s father, laden with endless reminders and cautions, insisted that if the search proved fruitless, I shouldn't force it. He urged me to return swiftly and only stopped escorting us when we reached the entrance of Tuanshanzi.\n\nI was fairly confident in my ability to locate ancient tombs, especially if I managed to reach Wildman Gully. Whether or not there were any tombs to be found, if they existed, I was certain I could uncover them. My knowledge of tomb raiding was partly gleaned from books and largely from stories told by my grandfather, Hu Guohua, who had served as an officer in the old warlord's army. Some of his soldiers had once been under the command of Sun Dianying, a notorious tomb raider of the Eastern Tombs, and had participated in several large-scale tomb raiding operations. Their experiences were vast, and it was from their accounts that my grandfather had learned much.\n\nHistorically, tomb raiding fell into two categories: official and civilian. Official raiders operated openly, targeting imperial mausoleums. Xiang Yu, the Hegemon-King of Western Chu at the end of the Qin Dynasty, could be considered the forefather of official raiding. During the Three Kingdoms period, the so-called Tomb Raider armies merely systematized this official plundering into an assembly line operation. Among civilians, there were amateurs and professionals\u2014the former would dig up anything they came across, while the latter specifically sought the graves of nobles and princes, disdaining smaller finds.\n\nThe key to tomb raiding lay in the ability to locate ancient tombs, a profound discipline in its own right. With thousands of years of dynastic changes in China, the construction and site selection of imperial mausoleums varied greatly. During the Qin and Han dynasties, the trend was to build inverted-cone-shaped burials, with the mound shaped like an inverted measuring cup, its edges clearly defined, and a small square platform at the peak. Some resembled the pyramids of Egypt, albeit with an additional side, and were astonishingly similar to the pyramids of the lost Maya civilization in South America. The connection between these, however, remained a mystery.\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty, mausoleums were carved out of mountains, reflecting the monumental scale and majestic spirit of the era, which corresponded with the great national strength of the prosperous Tang Empire. The royal tombs of the Tang Dynasty exuded an air of imperial supremacy, as if declaring, \"Who else but I should be considered the foremost under heaven?\"\n\nFrom the Southern Song Dynasty until the early Qing, China faced incessant warfare and some of the greatest natural disasters in its ancient history. With the nation's power weakened, the scale of the mausoleums for princes and nobles was no longer as extravagant as before.\n\nLater, during the Kangxi and Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty, the nation's economy and productivity greatly recovered. The architectural style of the mausoleums underwent a change, emphasizing above-ground structures and integrating them with ancestral temples and garden landscapes. Drawing on the anti-theft experiences of previous dynasties, the construction of underground palace tomb chambers in the Qing Dynasty was exceptionally sturdy, making them exceedingly difficult to breach.\n\n Ultimately, regardless of the era, the burial customs that have persisted throughout China's millennia-spanning history all stem from the intricate layouts derived from the sixty-four hexagrams of Fuxi, intertwined with the Five Elements and Feng Shui. Despite endless variations, they never stray from their essence, all aiming to capture the world's geomantic advantage. At their core, they pursue an eight-character maxim: within the workings of nature, humanity and the cosmos are one.\n\nThis mortuary culture encapsulates the quintessence of Chinese civilization. Various ethnic groups such as the Mongols, Huihu, Tubo, Jurchen, Xianbei, She people, Dangxiang, and others have been greatly influenced by it. The layouts of their mausoleums often imitate those of the Central Plains, yet most only manage to grasp the superficial aspects. It can be said that anyone who understands how to read the veins of the world's mountains and rivers can effortlessly locate even the most hidden ancient tombs.\n\nMoving forward, an endless expanse of primeval forest unfolds. Yingzi, leading with eight large dogs, clears the path ahead, while Fatty, leading a stout horse laden with tents and various supplies, follows. I bring up the rear, carrying a hunting rifle as we all enter the towering mountains of the Sino-Mongolian Border.\n\nAs we trek, Fatty inquires of Yingzi ahead: \"Big sister, what's the deal with the Wild Man of Wildman Gully? What exactly is a Wild Man? Have you ever seen one?\"\n\nYingzi glances back and replies, \"I don't really know what a Wild Man is. I've heard from my father that many have seen one over the years, but no one has ever caught one alive, nor have they found a body. Those who have seen it can't clearly describe what it looked like.\"\n\nFrom behind, I laugh and say, \"Fatty, you're truly uncultured. As the name implies, a Wild Man is a person who's wild by nature. You should study more. Do you know what a wild person is? It's someone born in the wild, perhaps from a tree or grown from the ground, but definitely not man-made.\"\n\nThe Wild Man is shrouded in mystery. The legend of the Wild Man of Shennongjia has been around for a long time. I heard about it while in the army; it's said that a People's Liberation Army soldier once shot and killed a Wild Man there. The body of the Wild Man fell off a cliff, and in the end, it remained unclear whether the Wild Man was human or just a large, hairy monkey. Nearly all eyewitnesses who have seen a Wild Man insist that it is tall and strong, covered in fine, black hair.\n\nListening to Yingzi's story, we learn that the Wildman Gully at Black Wind Pass wasn't always called that. It used to be known as Dead Man's Gully, and even earlier, it was called Moon Cradling Gully. It has long been a burial ground for the nobility of the Great Jin dynasty. Later, when the Mongol forces decisively defeated the main army of the Jin at Black Wind Pass, the bodies piled up like mountains. The Mongols threw the dead into the gully, nearly filling the entire valley, which led the locals to call it Dead Man's Gully. Over time, sightings of the Wild Man near this valley led to the name being replaced by Wildman Gully.\n\n There's nothing to fear from the Wild Man; how could it possibly be more formidable than a Tibetan Mastiff? Suddenly, a thought crossed my mind: I wonder how much a Wild Man would fetch on the market. But then I reconsidered, realizing that such an idea was inhumane. It would be better to focus on tomb raiding\u2014that was a more legitimate pursuit.\n\nTraveling with horses meant we couldn't navigate steep slopes, so we often had to take detours around large mountains. Our journey was slow, but the autumnal primeval forest was a feast for the eyes, with its resplendent scenery of red and yellow leaves blanketing the hillsides in a rich tapestry of color that never failed to captivate. Occasionally, we would spot pheasants, hares, roe deer, and wild boars darting out from the depths of the woods. Yingzi would then release the dogs to give chase. By nightfall, we would set up camp, gather wild herbs and spices from the mountains, and light a campfire to grill our catch. Both Fatty and I relished these meals, never once repeating the same wild game dish.\n\nNavigating through these mountains without hunting dogs meant resigning oneself to sleeping in the trees. But with three Giant Mastiffs and five Large Hunting Dogs, our pack was a formidable force in the forest, unmatched unless we encountered more than three Human Bears. Yingzi said that the mastiffs were the bane of Human Bears, which would immediately keep their distance upon hearing the dogs' barks. So, we slept in tents at night, with our loyal hunting dogs standing guard around us. There was nothing to worry about; these dogs were far more reliable than people.\n\nYingzi's temperament was far fiercer than that of a young swallow, as fiery as a hot pepper. Whether it was choosing our path or deciding what to eat, we had to follow her lead\u2014after all, she was our guide. Even the dogs heeded her commands. Although I was accustomed to being a Company Commander, in her presence, I had to swallow my pride and become just another soldier.\n\nBut Yingzi truly had skills. Whether it was hunting, finding paths, locating springs, or distinguishing poisonous mushrooms in the deep mountains, she knew it all. She could find wood ear mushrooms, hazelnuts, persimmons, codonopsis, schisandra berries, and more with ease. There was nothing she didn't know. She could even identify animals I had never seen or heard of in my life, explaining their habitats, diets, and how to capture them with specific traps. Fatty and I could only look at each other in amazement and concede with two words: Impressive.\n\nThe Oroqen people, to which she belonged, were born hunters. \"Oroqen\" is the official name given to this ethnic group, though it's not entirely accurate. Sometimes they refer to themselves as \"Elunchun\" or \"Olu'enchun,\" which means \"deer-hunting people wandering through forests and mountains.\" They have roamed the forests of the Lesser Khingan Range for years, living a nomadic life of fishing and hunting. When China was first liberated, there were less than a thousand Oroqen people left. The government resettled them from the harsh living conditions of the Deep Mountain Old Forest to a more sedentary lifestyle. However, the people held a near-deification reverence and longing for the nomadic hunting life of their ancestors. They worshipped Shamanism and venerated nature. Even though they had settled down, they would still frequently venture into the mountains to hunt.\n\n Throughout the journey, we exchanged few words, keeping our conversations brief. For six or seven days, we trekked through the primordial forest, finally reaching the Black Wind Pass at the Sino-Mongolian Border. The density of the forest at Black Wind Pass is indescribable; in its depths, there is scarcely a place to stand firm. The forest is dominated by cold-resistant species such as red pine, larch, birch, and poplar. The ground is layered with fallen branches and leaves, each step sinking into the detritus. For humans, it's manageable, but the horses, with their significant weight, frequently get stuck, unable to move. We had no choice but to exert all our strength, pulling and dragging them along, inching our way forward.\n\nWho knows how many years it's been for the layers beneath us, with rotting foliage and carcasses of wild animals emitting waves of putrid odor. This foul stench, mingling with the scent of red pine and wildflowers, creates a peculiar aroma\u2014unpleasant at first, yet strangely addictive over time.\n\nUpon arrival at Black Wind Pass, the rest was up to me. We found a valley that must have been the legendary Wildman Gully. At first glance, it lacked the fierce appearance of Lama Gully, but this was merely a superficial impression. Yingzi cautioned that the valley might contain opium dens, insisting we must be absolutely certain before descending. Falling into an opium den would mean no escape. To venture into Wildman Gully, each of us needed to prepare a large wooden stick to probe the path ahead; the layer of fallen leaves was deeper than any marshland. Fortunately, it wasn't the rainy season, or the descent would have been impossible.\n\nWildman Gully is an offshoot of the Greater Khingan Range, flanked by gently sloping mountains. The valley runs north to south, with hills on both the east and west. The central area receives very little sunlight throughout the year, casting a gloomy pall over the space. The valley floor is filled with decaying leaves and wild grass, and apart from some sparse, low shrubs, no trees grow here. Beyond the valley, the trees grow even sparser, marking the end of the primeval forest. Two hundred li further lies the vast Mongolian grasslands.\n\nAs dusk approached, the blood-red sun hung on the horizon. We climbed a hillside and looked out to see the setting sun about to sink, the sky streaked with swathes of crimson clouds, as if painted with thick oils. The forest-covered mountains and the endless grasslands in the distance all blurred into a hazy vista. It was a scene of mountains vast as seas, with the dying sun like spilt blood.\n\nFatty, beholding this magnificent view, felt an immense joy: \"Old Hu, this scenery is too beautiful. Our journey has not been in vain.\"\n\nMy mind, however, was preoccupied with the ancient tomb in Wildman Gully. I carefully examined the valley's topography, comparing it with the Sixteen-Character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Secret Technique, and took out my compass to discern the Eight Trigrams. In my heart, I whispered a secret passage: \"At last, we've found the right place. There must be a noble's ancient tomb hidden in this valley.\"\n\n Wildman Gully, formerly known as Moon Cradling Ravine, is a place where the terrain exudes a stately and majestic presence, as if it could swallow the universe whole. One end borders the grasslands, while the other connects to the Greater Khingan Range. The vast Mongolian grasslands stretch out like an endless ocean, and Moon Cradling Ravine is like a mighty river flowing into this sea.\n\nThough the geomantic elegance of this place might not befit the burial of emperors, it's more than sufficient for princes and high-ranking generals. When the moon reaches its zenith, its light will reveal the location of ancient tombs.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sun gradually sinks below the western horizon, and the great forest is on the brink of being devoured by shadows. This place was once called Moon Cradling Ravine because when the moon rises directly above the valley, if you lie on your back at the deepest point and look up at the sky, the peripheral vision creates an illusion. The highest hills on either side appear as two enormous arms, reaching up towards the bright moon. The deceased here are believed to be embraced by the essence and auspicious energy of the sun and moon, as detailed in a chapter of my ancestral book on geomancy. Although some of the text is obscure, it's not difficult to infer the general idea with on-site observation.\n\nIf Wildman Gully were not covered with a thick layer of dead leaves and rotting grass, we could easily find the central point. But now, we must wait for the moon to rise at night, using its position in the sky as a reference to find the ancient tomb at the valley's deepest point. Our manpower is limited, and we cannot afford any deviation during our work, or the scale of the project would be overwhelming.\n\nWith midnight still some time away, we pitch our tent under a large tree on the hillside, tether our pony to the tree, feed it fodder, light a bonfire to boil water for dinner. Tonight's game is a young deer caught by the hunting dogs, an odd-looking creature with piebald spots, uneven in size, with unusually thick hind legs, large ears, and no antlers, likely a doe.\n\nYingzi rushes over when she sees the dogs dragging this strange deer, quickly flipping the deer over to inspect its belly, which is smeared with fresh blood. She pries open the deer's mouth as if searching for something, but ultimately finds nothing. Frustrated, she kicks the deer's body hard twice and scolds the large hunting dogs: \"You useless creatures, all you know is to eat, can't count on you for anything. None of you gets to eat today.\"\n\nFatty watches in curiosity and asks Yingzi, \"Big sister, what are you looking for?\"\n\nYingzi, while skinning the deer with a sharp knife, answers Fatty's question: \"Fatty, you've never seen this animal before, have you? This is a musk deer. Inside the navel of a female musk deer, there's musk. Goodness, it's worth a fortune. But these creatures are cunning thieves. As soon as they see someone coming to catch them, they'll bite off their own navel first, chew it to a pulp. Damn it all,\" she curses, \"if these dogs had been a bit faster, we could have gotten a piece of musk.\"\n\n After hearing this, Fatty sat down against a large tree, his head bowed and back bent, pressing down on his belly over and over with force.\n\nI slapped his head: \"What on earth are you thinking? Do you fancy yourself a deer, able to nibble at your own belly button? Besides, your navel's full of dirt, it's worthless.\"\n\nFatty became anxious: \"Nonsense, my back is itchy. I'm just rubbing it against the tree. You're the one acting like you want to bite your own belly button.\"\n\nAfter a few rounds of banter, we split up to take care of our tasks\u2014I went to gather dry firewood, and Fatty went to help Yingzi roast the meat. We only needed to roast one of the musk deer's hind legs to have enough to eat; we fed its innards to the five big hunting dogs. Yingzi, with her sharp tongue but a soft heart, had earlier declared she wouldn't feed the dogs dinner, yet now she worried they wouldn't have enough to eat.\n\nThe other three giant mastiffs sat proudly at a distance, not even deigning to glance at the common hunting dogs fighting over the animal's entrails. Yingzi gave the musk deer's two front legs to two Tibetan Mastiffs and one of the hind legs to the largest Giant Mastiff named Tiger.\n\nThe three of us gathered around the campfire to eat the roasted meat. Yingzi provided each of us with a small knife and a little bowl made of rock salt. The deer leg was turned over the flames to roast, and we sliced it piece by piece with our knives, rubbing it in the bowl to give it a salty flavor. The meal was consumed quickly; my mind preoccupied with the ancient tomb in the gully, I couldn't even discern the difference in taste between the musk deer's meat and that of ordinary deer.\n\nAfter the meal, the moon had risen, and by its light, we could see the clouds moving swiftly overhead\u2014a sign that strong winds would come at night. Seeing that the time was about right, we left the hunting dogs to guard the camp and the three of us, each armed with a wooden stick and a hunting rifle, descended into Wildman Gully.\n\nWith every step forward, we plunged the wooden sticks into the ground ahead to check for opium traps. The conditions at the bottom of Wildman Gully were much better than we had anticipated. Although in some places the fallen leaves were as thick as one's thigh, there was no swamp formed by opium-soaked leaves that had been drenched and rotted by rainwater. It seemed that if we wanted to excavate the ancient tomb, we would first need to clear away the leaves covering it.\n\nI looked up at the moon, took out my compass for comparison, and surveyed both sides of the valley. Finally, I determined the location\u2014the valley likely contained many ancient tombs, but the most significant one, belonging to a noble of high status, was right beneath where we stood.\n\nI planted a wooden stake there as a marker. We would return to get a good night's sleep and come back early the next morning with renewed energy to start the excavation. In this deep mountain old forest, with no other people for hundreds of miles around, there was no need to sneak around and work at night.\n\n As I made my way back, I regaled Fatty with tales of tomb raiding. Anyone involved in this business ought to be well-versed in such matters; it's not enough to rely solely on brute force and dig blindly. Ever since we ventured into the mountains, I've been ceaselessly educating him.\n\nIn China, the earliest recorded incidents of tomb raiding date back roughly three thousand years to the Zhou Dynasty\u2014a time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, spanning the Xia, Shang, and Zhou periods. This era was further divided into the Western and Eastern Zhou. It's the same dynasty upheld by the likes of Jiang Taigong in \"Investiture of the Gods,\" where phoenixes cried on Mount Qi. With a foundation lasting over eight hundred years, two major tomb raiding events from that epoch stood out: one was the looting of King You of Zhou's tomb, the other was the desecration of King Tang of Shang's grave. In King You's tomb, raiders found two exquisitely preserved young male and female corpses, frightening them into a hasty retreat. Meanwhile, King Tang's tomb yielded a large tortoise shell inscribed with oracle bone script.\n\nFatty interjected, \"Old Hu, quit bothering me with this irrelevant stuff. Just tell me if there are ghosts in the tombs. If there are, how do we deal with them? And what about that 'Ghost Blows Out the Light' you mentioned last time? It sounds so sinister.\"\n\nYingzi asked, \"What's this 'Ghost Blows Out the Light'? Is it that thing from the Northeast where the ghost extinguishes the light?\"\n\nI clarified, \"It's not the Northeastern superstition but a belief among tomb raiders. It might not be entirely useless, though. Poor air quality in a tomb chamber could mean certain death from poisoning if a candle won't stay lit, and that's something that can be explained scientifically. Besides, how could there be ghosts in ancient tombs? Those are just superstitious tales. Even if there were, we needn't worry\u2014I've prepared black donkey hooves, glutinous rice, and other such items to ward off evil. In short, when it comes to tomb raiding, don't fall for superstitions. If you're afraid of ghosts, you shouldn't be tomb raiding.\"\n\nFatty had an epiphany, \"So that's it! You had Yingzi prepare all these things for exorcism. I thought you were just acting tough, not afraid of ghosts at all. By the way, what are the vinegar and birdcage for?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, a cacophony of hounds barking wildly echoed up the slope. We all felt a sinking feeling in our hearts, fearing that some wild man or beast might be attacking our camp. But with three giant mastiffs there, not even the most daring creature, emboldened with the heart of a bear and the gall of a leopard, should dare cause trouble. What could possibly be setting the hunting dogs off? We quickened our pace, rushing back up the slope.\n\nUpon reaching the tent, a gruesome scene unfolded before us. The pony tethered to the tree had been savagely mauled by some ferocious beast; its belly was torn open, its intestines spilled out onto the ground. The pony was not yet dead, convulsing on the ground, though its fate was sealed.\n\nThe hounds circled the dying pony, barking furiously as if they had witnessed some horrifying spectacle. Their cries were filled with a restless agitation.\n\n Ordinarily, horses and dogs are friends, so it was unthinkable that a dog would have bitten the pony's intestines. What sort of beast could have done this? Three heads of Giant Mastiffs and five hounds circled nearby, yet they failed to catch the perpetrator.\n\nLooking around, there was no sign of any wild beast, only the silent mountains, the night wind rustling the leaves in the forest, causing cold sweat to drench our palms as we gripped our hunting rifles.\n\nBlood frothed from the horse's mouth, and steam still rose from its nostrils. Though its intestines had spilled out onto the ground, it struggled for breath for quite some time. Yingzi aimed at the horse's head and fired a shot, ending its pre-death agony.\n\nSuddenly, I noticed the horse's intestines moving, not in a post-mortem reflex, but as if something was pulling them underground. Whatever was tugging at the pony's innards was hiding beneath the carcass.\n\nI quickly pulled Yingzi back a step. Fatty and Yingzi had also seen what had just happened. We exchanged glances, all thinking the same thing: could it be the work of a Wild Man?\n\nBeing in Wildman Gully, the first suspect was naturally the Wild Man. But did a Wild Man possess the strength to tear open a horse's belly? Perhaps it used a weapon, but if it had the skills to craft a weapon, it wouldn't be a Wild Man. It seemed the hypothesis of the Wild Man's involvement was untenable.\n\nBefore we could figure it out, the intestines were completely pulled under the horse. The situation beneath the carcass was entirely obscured from view.\n\nWe needed to move the horse's body. I weighed the hunting rifle in my hand; this gun was far more advanced than the old musket I had used more than a decade ago in Lama Gully to hunt a Human Bear. However, this sporting rifle had too small a caliber to be lethal to large predators. Nonetheless, in such a situation, having it was better than nothing\u2014it certainly beat a fire-poking stick.\n\nArmed with rifles and dogs, we felt somewhat reassured. Together, we pushed the horse's body aside, revealing a deep hole in the ground, hidden by the grass, with a diameter as wide as a small bucket.\n\nThe hole was too narrow for an adult to crawl through. It was into this hole that something had dragged the pony's intestines. When we had first arrived, the hole had been concealed by grass, which is why we had tethered the horse nearby. While we were searching for ancient tombs in the valley below, the creature in the hole had suddenly attacked, tearing open the horse's belly. Although the hounds were fiercely unmatched, they could do nothing as the carcass blocked the entrance, barking in frantic helplessness.\n\nShining a flashlight down the hole, it was pitch-black, its depth unknown. Observing the marks on the walls of the hole, my experience as an Engineer Soldier for over three years came into play. I was almost certain that the hole was not man-made but dug by some animal with sharp claws\u2014a skilled burrower\u2014otherwise, it couldn't have ripped open the pony's abdomen so effortlessly. But what kind of animal it was, I truly couldn't fathom. Even Yingzi, who knew the forest like the back of his hand, shook his head in bewilderment, having never seen nor heard of such a creature.\n\n I suspect there are other entrances nearby. Wildman Gully may seem tranquil and scenic, but it conceals deadly dangers. No wonder the team that came tomb raiding here decades ago vanished without a trace. Perhaps they too encountered these savage subterranean beasts.\n\nIt's unwise to linger here. We've decided not to wait for dawn and to move out at night instead. We split into two groups: Fatty and I, with five hunting dogs, headed down to the valley to excavate tombs, while Yingzi, accompanied by three giant mastiffs, searched nearby for the creature that attacked us. No matter how formidable it may be, it couldn't surpass the ferocity of the three mastiffs. Better to strike first than to wait defensively. Should either group encounter trouble, we'd fire a shot to alert the other, who would rush to provide support.\n\nFatty led the pack of hounds while I carried tools and other necessities. We descended into the valley, following the path we had scouted earlier.\n\nI took out two engineer soldier shovels, kept one, and tossed the other to Fatty. \"Hurry up with the work, Fatty. It's not wise to dig deep here. The ancient tomb beneath the layer of fallen leaves won't be too deep. The sooner we find the antiques, the better. Then we can leave this haunted place and go home, sell them, and build a road for our fellow villagers.\"\n\nFatty spat on his hands: \"Watch the master at work.\"\n\nHis German-made sapper's shovel flew up and down, each thrust dislodging a large clump of the mire formed by dead branches and fallen leaves.\n\nAlthough there weren't many trees in Wildman Gully, the wind would blow leaves from the surrounding mountains into the valley, accumulating over the years into a substantial layer. We took turns digging, reaching a depth of six or seven meters, until we finally saw soil. I grabbed a handful; it was fine-grained, without any clumps, and tasted slightly sweet when I tested it with the tip of my tongue. There was no mistake\u2014it was a burial mound, and just four or five meters down would be the tomb chamber.\n\nOne must be cautious when nearing the tomb chamber, for some tombs have theft prevention mechanisms. The ancient tombs from the Northern Song Dynasty and the Liao and Jin periods didn't use the simple traps like falling rock traps common before the Tang Dynasty. By the Northern Song Dynasty, anti-theft technology had matured, especially in the tombs of the nobility. They couldn't undertake projects as grandiose as the imperial tombs, and the manpower they could mobilize was limited. But relatively speaking, the contents were by no means inferior; otherwise, they wouldn't match the feng shui treasure land they occupied.\n\nAn ancient tomb from the Late Northern Song Dynasty of the Jin people, like this one, would likely use the popular anti-theft technology of the time: the Tianbao dragon fire glazed tile roof. This structure's craftsmanship was highly advanced. The tomb chamber was hollow, with a layer of ultra-thin glazed tiles on the ceiling, each tile holding bags of Western Region Fire Dragon Oil. Another layer of glazed tiles was placed on top, followed by the burial mound. Any external force would break the fragile ceiling, the Fire Dragon Oil would ignite upon contact with air, and the flames would incinerate everything inside the tomb chamber\u2014bones, burial artifacts\u2014leaving nothing for the tomb raiders.\n\n Of course, this was a measure of last resort. The Tomb Master would rather die than let the tomb raiders desecrate his remains. This sort of government agency was only briefly popular during the late Northern Song Dynasty, in the Jin-Liao period. Eventually, it was supplanted by more advanced agencies, and the Tianbao Dragon Fire Glazed Tile Roof became obsolete.\n\nSuch a minor agency could not escape my notice. Its greatest weakness lies in the fact that if you dig from the side, the dragon fire glazed tiles on top won't break. Hence, once we reached the burial mound, we shifted to digging deeply on the side. The two of us worked feverishly, not knowing the meaning of fatigue, and eventually dug a large pit some six or seven meters deep.\n\nUnwittingly, daylight had already broken. Yingzi returned to say she found nothing nearby and went into the woods to prepare lunch, promising to send a dog to call us when the meal was ready.\n\nAfter Yingzi left, we continued our work and finally hit a layer of hard soil, as solid as rock. When the engineer soldier's shovel struck it, only a white mark appeared.\n\nFatty cursed, \"What the hell, is that cement? If I'd known, we would have brought some explosives. Keep digging.\"\n\nI replied, \"Explosives are for the crude. This is a tamped earth layer. It's protected by a government agency on top, and the builders wouldn't have overlooked the sides of the tomb chamber. This soil was mixed using a secret court recipe from that time, containing glutinous rice juice, boy's urine, and all sorts of messy stuff\u2014stronger than modern concrete, I tell you. This secret formula belonged to the emperor of the Northern Song Dynasty. After the Jin state conquered the Northern Song, the recipe ended up in the hands of Jin nobility.\"\n\n I hauled the large barrel of vinegar over, instructing Fatty to use a big ladle to drizzle it, spoonful by spoonful, onto the tamped earth layer. By the time the barrel was empty, the mortared wall of the tomb had nearly disintegrated. Vinegar might not seem corrosive, but it works wonders on this secret mix of rammed earth\u2014it's the perfect counter. Digging through it afterward would be as easy as slicing through tofu.\n\nAs we proceeded with the method, the tomb chamber was on the verge of being unearthed. While we were reveling in our success, a gunshot suddenly rang out from the woods, startling a flock of birds into flight.\n\nFatty exclaimed in a panic, \"That's my big sister's shooting!\"\n\nI grabbed the engineer soldier's shovel and the hunting rifle: \"Let's hurry and check it out.\"\n\nDespite our exhaustion, we sprinted through the forest, stumbling through the thick layer of fallen leaves with each hurried step.\n\nFollowing the sound, we rushed deeper into the woods, five large dogs trailing closely behind. After covering some distance, we saw Yingzi, accompanied by three giant mastiffs, charging toward us.\n\nRelieved to see she was unharmed, I asked, \"Big sister, was it you who fired the shot? What did you find?\"\n\nYingzi's face was pale, and she was panting heavily, \"Oh my goodness, it scared me to death. I stumbled upon some shanties up ahead. When I went in, it was terrifying\u2014all dead bodies, blackened and rotting. At first, I didn't see clearly and thought they were wild men, so I fired a shot. I didn't get a good look to see who they really were, though.\"\n\nThat's when I realized, despite Yingzi's usually tough demeanor, she had her fears\u2014dead bodies were her greatest dread. I had thought she was fearless in the forest.\n\nHowever, finding corpses and shanties in the deep mountains and old forests of the Sino-Mongolian border was incredible in itself. If they had built shanties, it meant they lived here. Who were these deceased, and why would they reside in such a remote, uninhabited wilderness?\n\n\"We should go take a look; there might be some clues,\" I mused, sensing a vague connection between these bodies and the group of tomb raiders who had vanished in this region before.\n\nYingzi led us to the shanties she had discovered. The structures were crudely made, constructed of mud and straw with a few wooden elements, all nestled densely among the trees, built high and camouflaged. They were nearly impossible to spot from a distance.\n\nWe clambered into one of the shanties to find numerous animal hides and, in a corner, indeed three corpses. The bodies were blackened from severe decomposition, the flesh nearly dissolved, and the skin shriveled. Maggots and ants moved in and out of the eye sockets and nostrils. I couldn't help but wonder if these were the rumored wild men of the Wildman Gully.\n\n Fatty leaned in for a closer look and said to me, \"Old Hu, I was wondering why there were no Wild Men in Wildman Gully. Turns out, they're all long dead.\"\n\nI nodded and replied, \"What's odd is that these Wild Men had rather advanced tools. Look, they're even wearing clothes. Since when do Wild Men wear clothes? And why do these garments look so familiar to me?\"\n\nThe corpses were all clad in Ni's Coats, worn for what must have been decades, now tattered and filthy beyond recognition. Yet, something about the style seemed eerily familiar, as if I had seen it somewhere before.\n\nI noticed something metallic on the collar of the innermost corpse's clothing. I plucked it off and wiped away the grime. It resembled a military uniform's insignia, but it certainly wasn't from our squadron.\n\nMeanwhile, Fatty had found something too. He fumbled in a corner and came upon a combat knife that hadn't been drawn in many years. With considerable effort, he finally pulled the blade free. Its steel edge was of exceptional quality; despite the years, it still shone brightly, reflecting its owner's meticulous care, no doubt frequently polished when he was alive.\n\nAt the sight of the knife, I understood. Damn it, the legendary Wild Men were actually these Japanese Devils.\n\nBut Fatty couldn't figure it out. \"Didn't all the Japanese return home after their defeat and surrender? How come these little ghosts didn't leave?\"\n\n\"It's not that surprising,\" I said. \"You know too little of history, revealing your true nature of ignorance. Stop the nonsense and listen\u2014I'll explain what likely happened.\"\n\n\"By my estimation, on the eve of Japan's unconditional surrender, the Soviet Union's Mechanized Army advanced southward, attacking the Kwantung Army stationed in China's northeast. They decimated what was claimed to be the most elite forces of the Japanese Army\u2014the million-strong Kwantung Army. Some of these ghosts were scattered, fleeing deep into the forests, too afraid to venture out and having lost contact with the outside world. Unaware of Japan's defeat and surrender, they hid in the forest until they died of old age right here.\"\n\n\"Some people encountered a few of these suspicious, skulking Japanese Devils\u2014clothes filthy beyond recognition, living in the forest without shaving. Weren't they easily mistaken for Wild Men?\"\n\n\"Of course, this is all conjecture on my part. The real reasons, unless these ghosts come back to life to confess, will forever remain unknown. After my explanation, both Fatty and Yingzi were able to comprehend.\"\n\n Yingzi said, \"Little Japan probably got lost. Don't be fooled by the fact that this is just the edge of the forest; head north, and it's all vast grasslands, and then there's the 'big mud pits'\u2014swamps that are nothing but mud. You can't get out that way. To the south lies the primeval forest, and without a dog to lead the way, even the most experienced of hunters wouldn't dream of finding an exit. Serves them right.\"\n\nAs I rifled through the belongings of these corpses, hoping to find something of value, a thought suddenly struck me. Could those who came here for tomb raiding in the late forties have encountered the Japanese devils, the derogatory term for the Japanese invaders during WWII? It was entirely possible they were killed by them. They wouldn't have expected to run into Japanese devils in such a desolate place.\n\nLost in thought, I suddenly found a notebook in a military rucksack. It was filled with Japanese writing\u2014the pages yellowed, but the handwriting still legible. None of the three of us understood Japanese, fortunately, the notebook contained many Chinese characters. We had no choice but to read it as if it were Chinese, focusing only on the Chinese characters within the Japanese text. However, the meanings of kanji in Japanese can be quite different, sometimes even opposite, to their meanings in Chinese. For instance, the Japanese kanji for 'stay behind' conveys a meaning that's the complete opposite of the literal Chinese interpretation. Even with such difficulties, by stringing these words together and adding some of our own conjectures, we could roughly understand half of it. The gist of it seemed to be:\n\nThe Kwantung Army of Dongning was crushed by the Soviet Army's mechanized troops, and Colonel Mu led the remnants of a small squad from the Type A Division of the Kwantung Army. The squad, consisting of soldiers, fled towards the Black Wind Pass to a secret underground fortress, intending to regroup with the remaining Kwantung Army forces inside the fortress and make a last stand against the Soviet Union, to serve the Emperor with their broken jade. However, as they neared their destination, they broke through the crust of an opium poppy field. The only soldier who knew the location of the fortress and the guide leading the way drowned in the quagmire, leaving the rest unable to find the entrance to the secret fortress. Attempting to turn back, they lost their way and, without any means of communication, were forced to settle in the deep mountains. There they remained for over thirty years, dying one by one. The narrative ends abruptly there\u2014I surmise the author met his death while penning these words.\n\n I tossed my notebook aside; there was no time for such rubbish now. The walls of the tomb in the valley were nearly eroded away. It was urgent to return, grab what we could, and leave, paying no further mind to the remnants of the Japanese Devils, as they were all but decayed into oblivion. Fatty declared the knife was mine to keep. Back in the day, my family had several officer's swords, all confiscated during the Cultural Revolution. I had been hoping to add one to my collection. I cautioned him that it was a regulated blade, impossible to carry on a train. Once we got back to Beijing, we could scour the Antique Market and perhaps purchase a new one for him.\n\nThe three of us hurried back to the ancient tomb in Wildman Gully. The work was nearly done, and with a few chops from an engineer soldier's shovel, a large hole was breached in the tomb wall. Shining my flashlight through it, I saw the space inside was quite expansive, though there was a drop of over a meter down to the floor of the Tomb Chamber. Fatty, elated, rolled up his sleeves, eager to enter, but I pulled him back with a firm hand. \"Have you lost your mind? Cage a few sparrows first and test the air quality in the tomb before anything else.\"\n\nCatching sparrows in the woods was an easy task, unlike in densely populated areas where they were cunning. We set the simplest of traps, scattering a few grains of millet and propping our cooking pot upside down over them. Hiding at a distance, we watched sparrows slip under the pot to peck at the grains. With a tug of a string, the supporting stick was pulled away, the pot trapping the birds beneath.\n\nWe caught three at once. I placed one in a birdcage, tied a rope to it, and lowered it into the depths of the Tomb Chamber. After smoking two cigarettes, enough time had passed, and I hauled the cage back up. The little sparrow inside was belly-up, its eyes rolled back in death.\n\nThis tomb, sealed underground for centuries, was devoid of air circulation. Before a corpse begins to decay, it first bloats, filled with Corpse Qi\u2014a miasma believed to emanate from the dead. Only after this swelling do the skin and innards begin to rot from the inside out. Although the Tomb Chamber wasn't a true vacuum, without ventilation, the stench of decay would remain trapped, lingering even after centuries. Even if Corpse Qi wasn't present, air that hadn't circulated for hundreds of years could form toxic gases harmful to the human body. Inhalation of such gases could, at the very least, cause dizziness and headaches, and at worst, lead to poisoning and death. Without a gas mask, this was not a step to be taken lightly.\n\n It seemed that the tomb would need a bit more time before the mountain winds could cleanse it of its poisonous vapors, so we returned to the hillside to eat some dry food and jerky. Having not slept the previous night and after a day of hard work, we were all exhausted. But the thought of the genuine treasures within the tomb swept away our fatigue. This was our first hands-on experience, and we were eager to unearth something valuable. My understanding of tomb raiding had until then been purely theoretical, but today's practice proved not too difficult. Of course, this was partly due to our choice of target. The Jurchen people of the Jin dynasty were considered an uncivilized tribe in their time, and the tomb they constructed was almost a complete replica of those from the Northern Song Dynasty, albeit on a smaller scale. It was likely built by captured Song artisans since the craft of creating Tianbao Dragon Fire Glazed Tile Roofs is complex, requiring skilled craftsmanship. The slightest error could lead to the tomb's builders being burned alive within.\n\nHaving finished our meal and noting the advancing hour, we surmised that the air within the tomb had sufficiently circulated. Concerned about a potential night attack from the creatures dwelling in the underground caverns, we were keen to retrieve the treasures and depart. So, equipped with our tools, we descended once again into the valley of Wildman Gully.\n\nWe first released a sparrow into the tomb, and seeing it emerge still lively and hopping, we were assured that the air was safe. Fatty and I took a few swigs of strong liquor to fortify our courage. Donning masks and gloves, hanging Touch-Gold Charms around our necks, and tucking Black Donkey Hooves and glutinous rice into our pockets, we grabbed flashlights and hung engineer shovels on our belts, ready to enter the ancient tomb.\n\nYingzi, seeing our preparations, urgently tugged at my sleeve and pleaded, \"Take me with you. I want to see what an ancient tomb looks like. I've never been inside one all my life.\"\n\nI replied, \"There's nothing much in ancient tombs, just ancient corpses and burial artifacts. What's there to see? Actually, this is also my first time. I've never been inside one before. And you, aren't you afraid of dead bodies? How come you're not scared now?\"\n\nDriven by a strong curiosity and seeing the secretive manner in which Fatty and I were conducting ourselves, Yingzi was itching to go inside. I figured, since we were in the desolate wilderness, there was no need for a lookout as tomb raiding thieves rarely work alone. Typically, they work in trios: one to dig, another to scatter the excavated earth since it can't be piled outside the pit, and a third to keep watch from a distance. Letting her have a look wouldn't do any harm. So, I found her a mask to wear and cautioned her, \"Once inside, never remove your mask. First, the air quality is poor. Second, the breath of the living shouldn't linger in the tomb\u2014it's inauspicious. Third, don't breathe onto the ancient corpses. Startling the dead could bring serious trouble. Although these are superstitious beliefs, these customs have been passed down for thousands of years and they hold their own logic. It's always better to be cautious. We'll follow the old ways to the letter.\"\n\n Fatty was already getting anxious: \"Hu Bayi, when did you become such a fusspot? If you're too scared to go down, let me do it myself. You guys just wait up here and count the money.\"\n\nI retorted, \"To hell with that. If you go down, you might not even find the coffin. Let's stop bickering; it's getting dark. We need to get to work.\"\n\nThe hole we had dug in the tomb wall was just over a meter above the floor of the tomb chamber. There was no need for ropes; we could simply climb down. As my feet touched the ground, my heart couldn't help but tense up\u2014it was a relief to finally be inside.\n\nThe tomb chamber wasn't large, barely thirty square meters in area, and seemed to be designed like the living quarters of the living, with a main room, a rear chamber, and two side chambers. We entered through a side chamber, and the tomb master's coffin was placed right in the center of the main room.\n\nThere was no burial bed\u2014instead, a shallow pit had been dug in the center of the main room, and the dark, somber coffin was placed within it, half-exposed. It was a tomb within a tomb.\n\nIn a corner of the main room, several skeletons were piled up, their skulls dented and cracked, clear signs of blunt force trauma. They were likely captives or wives and servants sacrificed for the burial. We weren't archaeologists, so we preferred not to dwell on these remains.\n\nYingzi suddenly grabbed my arm: \"Brother Hu, look, there are paintings on the wall.\"\n\nI shone my flashlight on the tomb wall where Yingzi pointed, and indeed, there were colorful bas-reliefs depicting various scenes. The figures in the paintings were rendered in an ancient and lifelike manner. Despite their age, the colors remained vibrant, but with the air circulating in the tomb chamber, it wouldn't be long before the frescoes began to fade.\n\nFatty exclaimed in admiration, \"It looks like the person buried here might have been a painter in ancient times.\"\n\n\"Don't pretend you know what you're talking about,\" I chided. \"During the Tang and Song dynasties, it was common for nobles' tombs to have murals that chronicled the significant events of the tomb master's life. Let's see who is buried here.\"\n\nThere were eight murals in total. We examined them in turn; some depicted hunting scenes in the forest, others showed drinking with friends in palaces, there were scenes of going to war, and of escorting captives. The final mural depicted a scene of being conferred nobility. In each painting, there was a man wearing a fox fur hat\u2014undoubtedly the tomb master. It seemed this was the tomb of a general, at least a marquis by rank.\n\nWhen the Jurchen forces swept south and overthrew the Song Dynasty, they looted a great deal of gold and treasure. This Jurchen general might have brought some of his spoils with him into the grave. After all, these treasures were originally ours, so we wouldn't be shy about taking them.\n\nThe three of us first made a round inside the tomb chamber. The two side chambers contained nothing but ceramic jars and pottery. The rear chamber held the bones of four horses and some armor and weapons. Aside from that, there was nothing else, suggesting the Jurchen didn't practice extravagant burials. I was somewhat disappointed. We lit candles in the southeast corner and gathered in front of the coffin in the main room. Whether we would find anything worthwhile depended on this final probe.\n\n The coffin of the Tomb Master was no small affair, crafted from mahogany and lacquered in black, adorned with golden patterns that were both bizarre in color and design. These likely had something to do with the ethnic totems of the Jurchen people. I ran my hand over the coffin lid; it was solid and thick, a luxury beyond the means of commoners who would consider themselves lucky to have a thin casket, while those even less fortunate might resort to being wrapped in a straw mat and buried haphazardly in the earth.\n\nThe cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me within the coffin world was the core of the Aquilaria tree, the heartwood that took thousands of years to mature. Such treasures were rare and sought after, reserved for royalty who could afford to have their corpses interred within this precious wood, ensuring that their flesh would never rot, more valuable than even crystal sarcophagi and more effective than the preservation offered by a refrigerator. Other woods like nanmu, duan hongmu, and millennium cypress were also prized for their thick cores, which not only prevented decay but also deterred insects and maggots from feasting on the body\u2014a fate no Tomb Master would wish upon their mortal remains. Thus, the choice of wood for a noble's coffin was a matter of stringent selection.\n\nThe coffin before us, while not on par with those of the imperial family, was still an extravagant piece. I inserted the blade of an engineer's shovel into the gap of the coffin lid, leveraging with force. To my surprise, it was securely nailed down, and it took several attempts before we managed to pry it open.\n\nFatty joined in with his tool, and together, with a concerted effort, we finally opened a large crack with the coffin creaking in protest. We shifted positions and one by one pried out the nails.\n\nThe tomb was exceedingly dry, its walls made of special materials that prevented water seepage. The glazed tiles overhead were also watertight, and most of the rainwater in Wildman Gully was absorbed by the layers of fallen leaves, so there was a considerable amount of dust within the coffin. Our disturbance sent dust swirling into the air, and even with our masks on, we couldn't help but cough incessantly. I resolved to prepare a few gas masks for future expeditions\u2014otherwise, we were bound to develop respiratory issues.\n\nAs Fatty moved to push the coffin lid open, I suddenly felt the urge to play a prank on him, to give him a bit of a scare. I grabbed his arm and said, \"Fatty, guess what's inside this coffin?\"\n\nFatty replied, \"How would I know? Whatever's inside, if we can exchange it for renminbi or the national food ration tickets, that's all that matters.\"\n\nI lowered my voice deliberately and said, \"My grandfather once told me a story from 'The Extensive Records of the Taiping Era,' about two tomb raiders, one fat and one thin. They unearthed a huge coffin in an ancient tomb and tried every method they could think of\u2014chopping with axes, hacking with knives\u2014but they couldn't open it. The fat tomb raider knew the Great Compassion Mantra, and when he recited it towards the coffin, the lid cracked open by itself, and an arm covered in green hair reached out from within.\"\n\nFatty wasn't scared, but Yingzi was frightened out of her wits, quickly hiding behind Fatty: \"Brother Hu, stop talking nonsense. Don't you see where we are? Are you trying to scare us to death?\"\n\n Fatty knew I was trying to spook him. Apart from his fear of heights, he was truly fearless. Back in the day at school, when it came to brawling with other kids, he was the fiercest of them all. Now, Fatty's face was a picture of courage, unmoved by my attempts to scare him, his expression one of noble righteousness. \"Yingzi, big sister, don't listen to him. This guy just wants to scare me. He seems to forget who Fatty is. What have I ever been afraid of? Let him go on.\"\n\nContinuing, I said, \"That arm, covered in green hair, with fingernails over three inches long, grabbed the fat tomb raider who was chanting the Great Compassion Mantra and dragged him into the coffin. The coffin lid immediately slammed shut, and from within, only screams could be heard, terrifying another tomb raider so much that he turned tail and fled.\"\n\nFatty forced a grin, a few strained chuckles escaping his lips. I guessed he was feeling a bit jittery inside, but he was determined to play the tough guy. He stepped forward to join me in pushing the coffin lid, but we applied too much force and ended up knocking the entire lid to the ground, revealing all that lay within the coffin.\n\nA tall male corpse lay there, its bodily fluids long since evaporated, leaving only a soy-purple dried skin clinging to the skeleton. After nearly a thousand years, this was still considered remarkably well-preserved, akin to the rare wet mummies unearthed from the Mawangdui in Hunan, which are one in a thousand. Although his facial features had collapsed into black hollows where his eyes and nose once were, his face was still faintly recognizable, appearing to be in his forties or fifties. He wore a heaven-reaching crown on his head, a red robe with blue-trimmed gold embroidery, cloud-treading boots on his feet, and his hands were placed on his chest.\n\nYingzi peeked inside from behind Fatty and let out a shriek: \"Oh my goodness, that's terrifying!\" She quickly averted her gaze, unable to bear the sight any longer.\n\nHer scream made my scalp tingle, but with the coffin already open, could we turn and run? Bracing myself, I pressed my hands together and bowed thrice to the ancient corpse: \"We are in dire straits, lacking food and clothing, and are forced to borrow a few genuine items to exchange for some modest funds. We mean no offense. After all, you should have ascended to heaven or descended into the earth long ago; wherever you were meant to go, you have gone. Dust returns to dust, earth to earth, and wealth and jewels are but worldly possessions, brought not into life and taken not into death. These treasures you've left behind serve little purpose now. We, even as thieves, have principles. After taking them, we will surely use the majority to build bridges and pave roads, to improve the lives of the people, following the exemplary model of Lei Feng, never forgetting our roots, with a clear distinction between love and hate, and a firm standpoint.\"\n\nBefore I could finish my speech, Fatty, unable to contain himself any longer, reached into the coffin, groping about. I hurriedly reminded him, \"Easy there, for heaven's sake. Don't damage the body.\"\n\n Fatty was unwilling to listen. Since entering the tomb chamber, he hadn't found anything of value, save for a few broken pots and jars, and the skeletal remains of burial companions. After all the trouble we'd gone through, it was time to see what treasures the tomb master's coffin might hold.\n\nSeeing that my attempts to persuade him were futile, I stopped wasting my breath and joined him in examining the contents of the coffin. The ancient corpse was surrounded by porcelain, a subject I knew little about at the time, especially porcelain. I had only seen a few pieces of blue-and-white porcelain from the Northern Song Dynasty and had no understanding of the value, craftsmanship, or history of these ceramics. I only knew that gold had a price, but jade was priceless. I was determined to find some ancient jade, so I carelessly tossed the porcelain aside. Fortunately, amidst my haphazard search, I found two jade bi discs in the hands of the ancient corpse. They were a vibrant green, carved into shapes resembling moths, yet not quite resembling butterflies.\n\nWe examined the pair of jade bi for a long time but couldn't determine what exactly they were. I only knew that they were likely made of jadeite and predated the Northern Song Dynasty, so they must be valuable. Otherwise, why would the tomb master clutch them in death? They could probably fetch tens of thousands at least, which was a significant sum, as there were not many households with that kind of wealth in the entire country back then. To ascertain their specific value, we would need someone like Big Gold Tooth, an expert in the field, to appraise them and then contact some Hong Kong and Taiwan businesspeople to sell them.\n\nFatty, not quite satisfied, wanted to pry open the ancient corpse's mouth to see if there were any gold teeth. I suggested that we had done enough and should not be too ruthless; it was only right to leave the deceased with some dignity. We picked out a few of the more attractive pieces of porcelain to take with us and returned the rest to their original places.\n\nAfter collecting the items, we lifted and replaced the coffin lid. Though we hadn't left with as much as we had hoped, we weren't leaving empty-handed either. I told them it was time to go, to repair the tomb wall and head home. As I turned to leave, I suddenly noticed that the candle in the corner had silently snuffed out.\n\nFatty and Yingzi (a personal name) noticed it too. Even though they wore masks, the foreheads that showed were covered in cold sweat. A layer of fine sweat covered my entire body as well. I somewhat regretted having exaggerated the horror of the phenomenon of 'Ghost Blows Out the Light' when discussing tomb raiding with them.\n\nI glanced back at the coffin. The lid was securely replaced and nailed down, not a sound to be heard. Could it be that ghosts truly existed in this world?\n\nYingzi (a personal name), who stood beside me, was deathly afraid of corpses and ghosts. She immediately reached to remove her mask, but I quickly held her hand and said, \"You can't take off the mask. What are you trying to do?\"\n\n Yingzi wanted to whistle for the hunting dogs to come inside, but I patted her shoulder and said, \"Don't worry, it's not time for that yet. Besides, dogs can't bite ghosts anyway.\"\n\nFatty walked over to look at the candles on the ground, then turned to ask me, \"Old Hu, how much did you pay for each of these candles?\"\n\n\"I bought them in Beijing and brought them here. I didn't really pay much attention to the price when I was shopping\u2014probably two cents each, I guess.\"\n\nFatty complained, \"Couldn't you have bought the ones that cost five cents each? For something so important, how could you settle for cheap goods?\"\n\nScratching my head, I replied, \"Next time I'll buy imported ones. Whichever is more expensive from America, Japan, or Germany, I'll get that. But the candles have gone out now, so let's not play the wise man after the event. Shouldn't we put everything back exactly as it was?\"\n\nIt had taken an enormous effort to get our hands on these few items, and neither Fatty nor I were keen on returning them all. It would be like making sticky rice balls without any filling\u2014completely pointless.\n\nFatty, undaunted, believed that even if a ghost really did show up, he'd smack it with a shovel until it was picking up its teeth off the ground. \"I'm taking all these items today,\" he declared. \"If you want them put back, a ghost will have to knock me flat first. Otherwise, no chance.\"\n\nYingzi felt it was better to put everything back. \"None of us know any spells for subduing demons or capturing ghosts. If we really stir up trouble with ghosts and goblins, none of us will make it out of the tomb alive.\"\n\nBefore I could speak, the two of them were already arguing. Eventually, they both agreed to my compromise: relight the candles, put back a few pieces of porcelain at random, and see if the candles stayed lit. If they went out again, we'd return another item. If that still didn't work, we'd only take the two jade pieces and leave the rest of the porcelain behind. Perhaps the candles had been extinguished by a gust of wind from outside the tomb chamber. If we didn't take something back after all our efforts, it wouldn't just be a shame\u2014it would be downright embarrassing.\n\nFatty slapped his thigh in agreement: \"That settles it. I'll put a small porcelain piece back first. Old Hu, you go relight the candle. If it goes out again, we'll just pretend we didn't see anything.\"\n\nBargaining with the spirits of the tomb like this, I might be the first to do so openly. If the tomb raiders of past dynasties knew what I was doing, they'd be so angry they'd rise from their graves just to strangle me. I'm truly a disgrace to our ancestors. But now, in the era of Reform and Opening-up, we should all adapt to the historical tide and not cling to those rigid, traditional rules. The economy needs to be invigorated, and so does our thinking. Without invigorated thinking, how can the economy thrive?\n\nAs I rationalized my actions, I took out a match and lit the candle in the corner of the wall. By then, Fatty had already placed a tri-colored porcelain vase with water patterns on top of the coffin. Too lazy to move the lid again, he simply set it on the coffin lid and came back to me, saying, \"There, no more problems. See, the candle isn't out. Should we start acting out the sixth scene from 'Shajiabang' now?\"\n\n Suddenly aware of some unusual circumstances, my nerves were on edge. When Fatty spoke, I was so startled that I didn't catch on right away, and I retorted, \"What the devil's 'Act Six'?\"\n\nFatty hit me with a head knocker, saying, \"What are you thinking about? It's the retreat in Act Six of the Shajiabang opera.\"\n\nI had no mind to pay attention to his words and gestured for him to be silent, pointing to the candle on the ground and whispering, \"Why the hell is the candle flame green?\"\n\nThe flame was emitting a strange, greenish glow, casting an eerie light on our faces that turned them a ghastly shade of green. Fatty and Yingzi also leaned in to look. Confronted with this sight, we exchanged glances, speechless. The candle's sickly green flame flickered twice and then snuffed out without any apparent cause.\n\nI knew this was bad luck; on my very first tomb raid, I'd run into a big zongzi \u2013 a serious problem. I grabbed Fatty and Yingzi by the arms and bolted towards the tomb raider's tunnel. The priority was to get out; I had no intention of staying behind to become a burial offering for the Jurchen barbarians.\n\nWe were nearing the tunnel entrance when a sudden gust of wind surged from behind. If we didn't dodge, it would surely hit us squarely. The three of us ducked down to the ground, narrowly avoiding the porcelain vase with water patterns that Fatty had placed on the coffin lid. It flew over our heads, shattered against the edge of the tomb raider's tunnel, and turned into countless fragments. Another loud crash followed as the coffin lid, which had been nailed back in place, was thrust so forcefully into the tomb wall that it embedded itself there, sealing the exit. The wall was made of tamped earth mixed with a secret formula from the Northern Song Dynasty, hard as rock. The coffin lid was extremely thick and heavy, thrown with unimaginable force. It would take significant effort and more than a moment's work with an engineer soldier's shovel to break through it.\n\n\"To embed the coffin lid in the tomb wall requires immense strength,\" I thought. \"Had we been slower, it could have crushed our heads.\" Even the usually fearless Fatty was terrified, his heart pounding with fear. \"Old Hu,\" he implored, \"you should go negotiate with it. We can leave a few more treasures behind. It's no good for anyone if things turn violent. After all, peace is most precious.\"\n\nThis first venture turning out so poorly, anger flared within me, and I fell back into my old impulsive ways. I turned around, shielding Yingzi behind me, drew the black donkey hoof from my bosom with one hand, and with the other, I brandished an engineer soldier's shovel at Fatty, saying, \"Negotiate my ass! It's blocked our way out, clearly wanting us to become burial objects. I've set my mind on these ancient jades today. Damn it, let's see who's tougher. Grab your weapons, and let's fight this damned ghost that's come barking up the wrong tree.\"\n\n At that moment, the lidless coffin within the main chamber had been propped upright, revealing the ancient corpse inside. Its once purple-hued, desiccated skin had, at some unknown point, sprouted a thick layer of red hair.\n\nI drew in a sharp breath at the sight, my earlier bravado to rush in and fight drained by half. I had heard tales of zombies growing white or black hair, known as the white and black fierce, and even of venomous corpse demons sprouting green hair, but this red-haired variety was new to me.\n\nWe had been too careless this time. Considering the tomb's modest size, we thought avoiding the government agency would suffice. Little did we expect to encounter a red-haired giant rice dumpling within. We hadn't brought our shotguns, and the tomb raider's tunnel we had dug was securely blocked, leaving no way to call down the big dogs for assistance. In the forest, the hunting dogs and shotguns were our Great Wall of defense, but now we were left with nothing but a German engineer soldier's shovel and a black donkey's hoof to do battle.\n\nHowever, the black donkey's hoof needed to be stuffed into the giant rice dumpling's mouth to be effective, and I had only heard of its use, with no guarantee of its efficacy.\n\nThe ancient corpse had grown red hair even on its face, rendering its features indistinguishable. It looked like a fiery red great ape, and with a shake of its arms, it leaped out of the coffin, covering over two meters in a single bound, its approach silent and swift as the wind. In just a few leaps, it was upon us, extending its ten dagger-like claws in a ferocious pounce.\n\nNever would I have imagined the giant rice dumpling to be so agile. In that critical moment, there was no time for thought. The fight chamber allowed no room for maneuvering; retreat was not an option. We had to counterattack to defend ourselves. Fatty and I shared the same thought: regardless of what it was, we would flatten it first and ask questions later. With a joint cry, we swung our engineer soldier's shovels at the red-haired ancient corpse with all our might.\n\nThe ancient corpse moved with astonishing speed, sweeping its arms horizontally. We felt a tremendous force collide with our hands, numbing our grip and forcing us to lose hold of the shovels. They flew up like leaves caught in a gale, clanging as they embedded themselves in the tomb chamber's glazed roof. Although it was dark above, the sound alone was enough to confirm that such a heavy blow could bring down the Tianbao dragon fire glazed tile roof at any moment.\n\nThe Western Region fire dragon oil was no trivial matter. Once spilled, the tomb chamber would be consumed by fire, the jade and stone burning together, and the tomb would be utterly destroyed. To escape, we had to end the battle quickly, but bare-handed, it was easier said than done.\n\n Deprived of their tools, the group hesitated to use the Black Donkey Hoof they held, a known counter to zombies, fearing the reckless act against the formidable Rice Dumpling. Such was its ferocity that one might be torn to shreds before the hoof could be stuffed into its maw. With no other choice, they dodged the Ancient Corpse's lunges, scrambling towards the back room where armor and horse bones were displayed.\n\nThe Tomb Chamber, devoid of light save for the beams of their flashlights, became even more treacherous as they fled. Fatty, just steps away from the back room's door, stumbled over a jar by the wall and fell to the ground with a cry.\n\nThe Red-haired Corpse Monster, shadowing their every move, pounced with a shriek that echoed through the narrow space like the wails of a night cat, a sound so harrowing and piercing it set one's nerves on edge and raised goosebumps on the skin.\n\nI had sworn, time and again, never to let any comrade-in-arms fall before me. Seeing Fatty's life hanging by a thread, I cast aside all thoughts of danger. With a kick, I struck the ghoul's chest\u2014a blow that felt like hitting a steel plate, sending a sharp pain through my leg that nearly snapped the bone.\n\nThe Red-haired Corpse Monster, reeling from the attack, abandoned Fatty and viciously swiped its claw towards my head. I hurled my flashlight at the creature and rolled beneath its arm, narrowly evading its talons. I now found myself trapped in a dead-end corner, the wall and the back of the corpse monster forming a triangle that penned me in. Should it turn and lunge at me again, I would stand no chance.\n\nI had faced death-defying situations countless times in my life, and it was in these moments of dire peril that calm was most needed. This red-haired Rice Dumpling was corporeal and brutish, impervious to blades and spears, but no ghost. It held no terror for me. Without further thought, I leapt onto the back of the Red-haired Corpse Monster. The stench that filled my nostrils was foul, and I thanked the heavens for my mask, which spared me from being overwhelmed by the odor before the fight even began.\n\nBlinded without my flashlight, I could see nothing in the pitch dark. The Red-haired Corpse Monster, with its stiff limbs, could not reach back to grab me, but it shook its body violently, trying to dislodge me.\n\nWith one hand, I clung tightly to the monster's neck, while with the other, I fumbled with the Black Donkey Hoof, trying to shove it into its mouth. I pressed it against the creature's face haphazardly, unable to locate its mouth. Instead, I was the one left dizzy and disoriented, stars flashing before my eyes\u2014a dire sign. A few more shakes and I feared I would be the one to fall first.\n\n Suddenly, in the darkness, a flash of light caught my eye. I thought I was seeing things, but when I looked again, I realized it was Fatty and Yingzi, each with a flashlight clenched in their teeth for illumination, charging toward me with a massive mace they had retrieved from the back room. They were ready for a direct confrontation. I quickly leapt off the back of the Red-haired Corpse Monster.\n\nThe mace weighed a hefty amount, a heavy single combat weapon from the age of cold arms. When we first entered the tomb, we had seen it among other weapons, armor, and horse bones piled on the ground in the back room, presumably used by the Tomb Master in battle during his lifetime.\n\nAlthough these weapons were coated with a verdigris patina, the product of long exposure to the air, the effectiveness of the mace did not rely on sharp blades but on the sheer force of its weight to crush the enemy. Fatty and Yingzi, flanking the sides, hoisted the mace with four hands and swung it like a temple bell hammer, slamming it into the chest of the Red-haired Corpse Monster. The weight of the mace, combined with their momentum, delivered a powerful blow that knocked the creature to the ground with a thud.\n\nThe two of them had exerted themselves too much and were now gasping for air. I thought I could almost hear their hearts pounding fiercely.\n\nI praised them, saying, \"Well done! I didn't expect such strength from you two. I'll make sure to commend you both when we get back.\"\n\nNo sooner had the words left my mouth than the Red-haired Corpse Monster sprang up from the ground as if it had springs attached. I cursed loudly, \"Damn it, it's like it can't be steamed soft or boiled tender! Fatty, hit it hard again, and this time aim for the head.\"\n\nFatty, fueled by rage, didn't wait for Yingzi's help this time. He mustered his brute strength, lifted the studded mace, and aimed a fierce blow at the Red-haired Corpse Monster. Unfortunately, the monster leapt forward at just the right moment, causing the mace to fly back into the back room, while Fatty was sent sprawling, his palms split open and bleeding, crying out in pain.\n\nA thought struck me\u2014the Engineer Soldier's shovel was stuck in the ceiling. If we wanted to break open the tomb door sealed by the coffin lid, we could use the mace. We needed to retrieve it from the back room, lure away the corpse fiend, smash the coffin lid, and rush out. There was more space outside, with hunting rifles and dogs at our disposal; we could handle the situation however we needed. Staying in this cramped tomb chamber limited our options.\n\nI helped Fatty up from the ground, and the three of us fled into the back room of the ancient tomb. This annex was lower than the main chamber. After descending, I shone the flashlight around and saw that the mace, thrown with tremendous force by the corpse fiend, had smashed a large hole in the wall of the back room. It was not just a pit but a hole\u2014could there be another hidden chamber beyond? I had heard tales of ancient tombs concealing secret chambers. Perhaps this was one such secret room. It seemed we had been quite mistaken this time.\n\n The gaping hole in the tomb wall, left by the violent strike of a spiked club, was a dark abyss. When illuminated by the flashlight, it appeared bottomless, revealing a long, expansive passage.\n\nAs I stood in astonishment, the red-haired corpse monster charged into the inner chamber, bringing with it a chilly wind. The three of us, not daring to hesitate, reversed our grip on the spiked clubs, hoping to push it back out and then rush to smash the coffin lid. However, the creature's strength was beyond imagination. With a lift of its arms, exerting a force of over a thousand pounds, our combined efforts were futile. The spiked clubs were once again sent flying, spinning through the air and striking the tomb wall behind us.\n\nThe crack in the wall now widened. With no other path available, we were forced to retreat into the secret chamber behind the tomb wall, bracing ourselves with the spiked clubs for another round of combat.\n\nYet, the red-haired corpse monster did not pursue us further; it simply circled the inner chamber. I let out a sigh of relief and shone the flashlight on the faces of Fatty and Yingzi. Aside from a hand injury that Fatty had sustained, none of us were seriously harmed. Reflecting on the series of fierce battles within the tomb chamber, which lasted only a few minutes, it felt as though we had narrowly skirted the gates of the underworld.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered something and grabbed Fatty's hand. \"Why aren't you wearing gloves? When did you take them off?\"\n\nFatty looked down at his hands. \"I was sweating so much while opening the coffin that I took off the gloves.\"\n\nI cursed at him. \"You're truly undisciplined! How many times have I told you to wear gloves when touching ancient corpses in a tomb? It could very well be your bare hands that provoked the red-haired giant 'zongzi' to rise from the dead.\"\n\nUnyielding, Fatty retorted, \"You're talking nonsense. An ancient corpse isn't a landmine that explodes upon touch. Don't you dare slander the innocent.\"\n\nYingzi, trying to mediate, interjected, \"Stop bickering, you two. Look, there are characters on this wall. What does it say?\"\n\nFollowing the beam of Yingzi's flashlight, we saw a red sign on the wall with bold letters: \"Black Wind Pass - Underground Gena Warehouse.\"\n\nFatty and I exchanged a glance. \"A secret fortress of the Kwantung Army... who would have thought that the underground passage of the Japanese fortress lay merely a wall away from the tomb's inner chamber? Just half a meter further in, and the tomb would have been breached. If it weren't for the spiked club being violently knocked against the tomb wall by the corpse monster, this deeply hidden military fortress might have remained undiscovered beneath the ground forever.\"\n\n Before I had time to take a closer look, the wall separating the ancient tomb's inner chamber and the fortress suddenly collapsed with a thunderous crash. The red-haired corpse creature had already leaped out from the broken wall of the tomb chamber.\n\nFatty cursed loudly, \"Damn it, like a pesky plaster that won't come off!\" Seizing his spiked club, he was ready to go head-to-head with the creature.\n\nI quickly stopped him, saying, \"Don't go toe-to-toe with it; let's find a way out first, then figure out what to do.\" Without a moment's hesitation, we took off running into the depths of the underground fortress. The passageways were incredibly spacious, with cement floors that could accommodate armored vehicles. However, the corridors were long and wide, with no cover or obstacles, and the red-haired corpse monster was incredibly fast, closing in on us from behind in an instant.\n\nI thought about throwing the Black Donkey Hoof to stall it, but as I frantically searched my person, my hand brushed against a pocketful of sticky rice. I had heard that ancient tomb raiders always carried sticky rice into tombs, as it could be used to draw out the poison if one was afflicted by corpse qi\u2014a term often used in Chinese fantasy novels referring to a kind of miasma or energy emitted by corpses. I wasn't sure if it would work on zombies, and this red-haired creature hardly looked like a typical zombie.\n\nA chilly wind blew from behind, carrying a putrid stench. I grabbed a handful of sticky rice from my pocket and flung it behind me at the red-haired corpse monster. The rice scattered over its face like flowers strewn by a celestial maiden, yet it seemed unfazed, merely pausing before continuing its relentless pursuit.\n\nBy now, we had reached the end of the underground fortress's passageway. The large iron door of the Gena Warehouse was ajar. It seemed the Kwantung Army had retreated in such haste that they hadn't locked the door. However, after thirty-odd years without use, the hinges were nearly rusted shut. The three of us dashed into the warehouse, gritting our teeth and using all our strength, finally managing to close the heavy iron door just before the corpse creature could get in.\n\nEven if the creature had a head of copper and arms of iron, it couldn't break through. We couldn't even hear it banging on the door from inside. The doors of this kind of military facility were designed to withstand explosive shockwaves, with two layers of quilting sandwiched between sheets of iron and steel to absorb the force. Back in the day, the Japanese devils\u2014derogatory term for the Japanese invaders during WWII\u2014were so terrorized by American air raids that even their underground fortresses were built to withstand large aerial bombs. Even if the corpse monster was formidable, it didn't have the destructive power of the U.S. Army's high-explosive bombs. We were safe for the moment, but figuring out how to get out was still a vexing problem.\n\n I sat on the ground, catching my breath, and shone my flashlight around. The warehouse was truly vast, with various supplies piled up like mountains. Given such a large space, it was puzzling how there were no traces of it on the outside. I calculated the direction and distance I had run and had an epiphany. It turned out that the hillside to the west of Wildman Gully had been hollowed out to create an entire Underground Fortress. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Japan had invested its national strength in the management of Manchuria, setting up its heavy industrial base to maintain the entire war situation, mostly within Manchuria. Especially after Japan\u2019s mainland suffered air raids from the U.S. Army, Manchuria had become Japan\u2019s strategic rear. To consolidate defenses, particularly against the northern threat of the Soviet Union, the Kwantung Army had constructed countless Underground Fortresses in Manchuria. These were permanent defensive installations. Although the place we arrived at was in Inner Mongolia, it was also part of the Occupied Zone of the Japanese Army during those years. The Japanese leadership believed in the principle of \"Defend Manchuria but not Mongolia,\" much like protecting the river but not the riverbanks. Thus, establishing peripheral defensive facilities for Manchuria along the Sino-Mongolian Border was a natural course of action.\n\nBlack Wind Pass was a strategic location coveted by military tacticians. If the Soviet Union's forces were to attack from the Grassland, this would be their inevitable path. However, in the end, the Soviets chose to attack from the Manchurian side, rendering this painstakingly built Underground Fortress strategically insignificant. Presumably, the defending troops in the Fortress must have received the Emperor's edict announcing the unconditional surrender over the radio. With morale dissolving, some committed suicide, while others fled.\n\nConstructing such a large-scale underground facility would have required a massive workforce. I shudder to think of the blood and sweat of the Chinese laborers that went into it, and it is very possible that, to keep military secrets, the laborers who built the Fortress were executed upon completion. The supplies in the Gena Warehouse had survived for over thirty years, with some still in relatively good condition. There might even be large-scale electrical equipment. It's a waste not to make use of the Ghosts' belongings\u2014if there's a way to return, I'll have the villagers organize a caravan to haul away the spoils of war.\n\n Fatty stood up and rubbed his sore spots; he had taken quite a tumble in the tomb chamber. Tearing two strips from his clothing, he asked Yingzi to help him bandage the wounds on his hands. His whole body ached as he cursed the zombies outside.\n\n\"I don't think those were zombies,\" I said. \"The black donkey hoof and glutinous rice didn't affect them. Besides, we've heard plenty about zombies. Shaanxi has the most. The custom there before the Ming Dynasty was to expose the dead to the sun for sixteen days, letting the bodies decompose before burial to prevent them from turning into zombies. When I was in the military in Lanzhou, I saw zombies with long black hair unearthed from the ground. I've heard there are ones with white hair too. Additionally, corpses buried with poisonous insects might turn green, but I've never heard of any with red hair.\"\n\nAfter Yingzi finished bandaging Fatty's hands, she interjected, \"That thing wasn't a zombie at all. I thought you knew\u2014it's a Corpse Demon.\"\n\nFatty and I had never heard of a Corpse Demon, so we asked Yingzi to elaborate. \"What is a Corpse Demon?\"\n\nYingzi recalled stories the elders in her clan used to tell. Long ago, when the Manchu people were still called the Jurchen, there was a form of witchcraft within their tribe known as 'zhuangsha,' which you may have heard of. During the burial rites, a piece of burnt talisman paper was placed in the deceased's mouth, and they held their most cherished possession in their hands. If tomb raiders came to steal, the corpse would become possessed, sprouting tough hair all over, impervious to blades and firearms, and would not rest until it had strangled the tomb raiders. The type of spirit summoned affected the color of the hair that grew on the corpse. These were just stories to me, but witnessing it today, I've realized such terrifying things do exist in this world.\"\n\nFatty pulled out two jade bi disks he had pried from the ancient corpse's hands. \"I'm not giving them back. If they want them, they can pay twenty thousand yuan for them, or even food ration tickets will do. But what's up with this jade?\"\n\nI examined the jade bi, which had turned from its original vibrant green to a pale yellow. I couldn't explain the change; I was suddenly aware of how limited my own knowledge and experience were. I had been somewhat self-important until recently, but now I saw that I still had much to learn.\n\nHowever, since we had already taken the object, fear was pointless. I stood up and rallied them both, \"Let's go further in and see if there are any firearms or ammunition. Best case, we find a tank and drive it right over that Corpse Demon, flattening it into a pancake.\""
                },
                {
                    "name": "Chapter 19: Kwantung Army Underground Fortress",
                    "content": "Fatty asked me, \"Do you have any military knowledge? It's impossible for there to be a tank here.\"\n\nI replied, \"Let's not jump to conclusions until we've had a look inside. Even if there really is a tank, it's unlikely to be operational after nearly forty years. Even with daily maintenance, it would be long past its service life by now.\"\n\nThe passageways within the Gena Warehouse were a labyrinthine tangle, akin to a maze. To prevent getting lost, we hugged the walls as we searched for an exit.\n\nThe corridors of the Underground Fortress, like those of the Gena Warehouse, boasted high, arched ceilings\u2014a waterproofing design. Shining our flashlights upward, we could see emergency lights and pipelines installed above. If we managed to find the generator, there might be a way to illuminate these lights.\n\nNot far along, we spotted a map of the Fortress on the wall, which marked out major passageways, the Traffic Trench, storerooms, Soldier Concealment Caves, shower rooms, Barracks, rest areas, granaries, drainage pipes, and the power station among other auxiliary facilities. However, crucial positions such as gun emplacements, ventilation shafts, Counterattack Holes, Observation Holes, and the Combat Command Room were not indicated. Inside the hill, the Fortress was divided into three levels. The complexity of its structure and the enormity of its scale underscored the Kwantung Army's emphasis on this Military Base in its heyday.\n\nI took the map down from the wall. Having served as a Combat Engineer and having participated in the construction of Military Facilities in the Kunlun Mountains, I was no longer worried about finding our way out with the map in hand. The sheer size of this secret Underground Fortress was beyond my imagination, stretching thirty kilometers in depth and over sixty kilometers in width at the front defenses. It turned out the hills on both sides of Wildman Gully had been completely hollowed out, forming two Permanent Support Defense Works that supported each other. Three passages ran transversely through Wildman Gully, interconnecting the Fortress beneath the hills on either side. The underground passage we had broken into from the Ancient Tomb of the Jin Dynasty General was the lowest of these three. The Fortress was thick at both ends and tapered in the middle; although the ends were vast, only three passages connected them. This design was likely a tactical consideration\u2014if one end of the Fortress were to fall to the enemy, the passages could still be severed to hold the other end.\n\n From our current position, the nearest exit wasn't too far away, but it was uncertain whether the Kwantung Army had deliberately sabotaged the fortress's exits during their retreat. Otherwise, the only way back might be through the ancient tomb, or perhaps we could attempt to escape through something like a ventilation outlet. Suddenly, I remembered what happened last night on the hillside: our horses had been eviscerated by a creature from an underground burrow. Could that very burrow have been a ventilation outlet of the fortress, enlarged by the creature's claws to serve as its lair? If that was indeed a ventilation outlet, there was no hope of climbing out through it; the hole was too narrow.\n\nI shared my thoughts with Yingzi and Fatty, asking for their input on how we might exit.\n\nFatty remarked, \"Hu, if you hadn't mentioned it, I'd have completely forgotten. The monster that attacked our horses might be using this underground fortress as its den. Wandering around blindly, we might bump into it at any moment. We need to find some weapons for self-defense.\"\n\n\"You're right, better safe than sorry. If the exit is destroyed, we'll have to climb out through the tomb's robber hole, which means another head-on clash with the Corpse Demon,\" I said. \"There should be an area in the Gena Warehouse where weapons and equipment are stored. Let's go see if we can find anything handy. Each of us should grab a few items. It would be ideal to find some Japanese Army field pumpkin hand grenades. Those grenades have a long shelf life and pack a considerable punch, perfect for dealing with Corpse Demons.\"\n\nThe Gena Warehouse was filled with various supplies: standard military coats, blankets, dry batteries, mess tins, gas masks, and more. Thanks to the unique construction of the fortress, the air here was relatively dry, preserving some of the materials quite well. I casually picked up a few Japanese Army Haruta-style gas masks and stuffed them into my bag. Finally, on the right side of the Gena Warehouse, I found the weapons storage.\n\nRows of iron racks were stacked with wooden boxes loaded with firearms. There were no machine guns, just rows of Arisaka Rifles, commonly known as the 'three-eight cover' or Type 38. Along the wall stood a few Type 60 Cannons, but not a single shell could be found nearby.\n\n Fatty pried open a wooden crate meant for rifles and grabbed one from inside. With a swift motion, he pulled back the gun bolt, shone his flashlight inside, and said to me, \"Old Hu, this gun's still good to go. They're all brand new, never unsealed, the mechanical parts all oiled up, and not a single bullet has been loaded.\"\n\nYingzi and I each picked up a rifle as well. I raised the Arisaka-style rifle, took aim, and then tossed it back: \"These lousy Japanese rifles only have a five-round capacity, with a non-automatic, rotating bolt action\u2014it's too slow to load, and the recoil is particularly strong. I'm not used to it.\"\n\nYingzi asked me, \"Little Ghost, what's not to like about this rifle? It packs a punch. My uncle used one like this when he first joined the Northeast Democratic United Army. Why don't you like to use it, Brother Hu?\"\n\nBefore I could reply, Fatty interjected: \"Don't mind him. He's been spoiled by playing with semi-automatic weapons every day in the army, and he's developed some quirks. Of course, he wouldn't fancy such an outdated gun. If we run into a Corpse Demon later, we'll just stand behind him and watch him show off his tricks of catching a wolf with his bare hands.\" While speaking, he rummaged through the bottom of the pile and found an ammo box. Upon opening it, he found bullets wrapped in oiled cloth, gleaming golden in the beam of the flashlight. Fatty had been pampered by his father since childhood, playing with guns as soon as he could walk. By the time he was in junior high, he was already an expert in firearms. Although he had never used an Arisaka-style rifle before, it was not unfamiliar to him. Seeing the ammunition, he skillfully pressed the bullets into the rifle, pulled back the gun bolt with a flick of his wrist, and aimed it at me.\n\nI hurriedly pushed the muzzle away: \"Don't point a loaded gun around carelessly. A gun's muzzle is not for pointing at comrades, only traitors aim their guns at their own. I don't like using this Type 38 because it's not suitable for close combat. The bullets have too much penetration power; at a distance of thirty meters, one shot could go through three or four people. Unless you fix a bayonet for close combat, it's too easy to hurt your own men. Plus, in the underground fortress with its many steel structures, a bullet hitting a steel plate could ricochet unpredictably. You might end up dealing with your own people before hitting the enemy.\"\n\nFatty slapped his chest confidently and said to me, \"With our marksmanship, it's not just blowing smoke. After all these years, you should know. Hitting a target a hundred steps away or shooting a lantern off a horseback is child's play for us. How could we possibly miss and hit a steel plate? Don't believe me? Let's try placing a chicken egg on your head later and see.\"\n\n I interrupted him as his talk grew increasingly erratic. \"Do you think it's easy for me to keep a level head? This head of mine is for pondering life, not for you to use as a target for egg-tossing. Let's not beat around the bush, shall we? See if there's another weapon we can use. I've always felt this kind of rifle isn't quite right\u2014after all, it's been obsolete for years. Old rifles are prone to misfire. Back when I was on the front lines in Vietnam, there was a civilian worker transporting supplies for us. He stole one of the old German-made guns we'd captured from the Vietnamese militia. Climbing a hill, the darn thing misfired, and just like that, it blew open the head of our deputy regiment leader. This isn't child's play.\"\n\nWe pried open the crates on the rack one by one, hoping to find a few of those field pumpkin hand grenades. Instead, in a wooden box marked with a plaster flag, we unearthed more than a dozen submachine guns with an odd design. A few resembled the British Sten submachine gun, with the magazine inserted horizontally on the left side of the gun. Unlike the British Sten, these had curved magazines and an additional wooden gunstock.\n\nYingzi asked me, \"Hu Ge, what kind of gun is this? Why does it look so strange? Is it a shoddy piece?\"\n\nI pulled on the submachine gun's bolt and removed the magazine to examine it. \"This is likely a Japanese-made Type 100 submachine gun. They only started equipping troops with it late in the war, and it wasn't produced in large quantities, so it's quite rare. It was probably intended for use against the Soviet Army. This gun is much more reliable than the Type 38, especially for close combat. If it jams, at worst, the cartridge gets stuck\u2014it won't misfire or backfire. You and Fatty should ditch the rifles and arm yourselves with a submachine gun for protection.\"\n\nYingzi had never handled a submachine gun before and didn't know how to operate it. She stood by our side, holding two flashlights to illuminate our work, while Fatty found a box of submachine gun bullets. Together, we loaded the bullets into the magazines.\n\nHumming a tune, I pressed the bullets one by one into the magazine, feeling quite pleased with myself. It had been a while since I had handled a submachine gun, and the memory of using the Type 56 in the army made my palms itch with anticipation. Lost in my moment of pride, Yingzi suddenly tapped my shoulder and whispered, \"Hu Ge, I think I just saw a kid run past behind you.\"\n\n How could there possibly be a child here? Deep within this old forest, where human footprints are scarce, let alone in this hidden fortress, buried so deep in secrecy. How could a child suddenly appear out of nowhere?\n\nWe were all squatting on the ground, loading bullets, with Yingzi crouched across from me, flashlight in hand. It was unintentional, a casual sweep of the flashlight's beam, when she glimpsed a child's figure darting behind me.\n\nI turned around, flashing the light in all directions. Behind me was a T-shaped passage, pitch-black and eerily quiet. Not a trace of a child to be seen. I asked Yingzi, \"What child? Have you scared yourself silly? Maybe your eyes are playing tricks on you.\"\n\nAlthough Yingzi was brave, being a girl from the mountains, she had a strong sense of feudal superstitious consciousness. Now frightened, her complexion had changed. \"I'm not lying; I really saw a child run past behind you. There's no mistaking it. There was no sound of footsteps, just the sight of a child's figure, really fast, just zipped past. Could there be a ghost?\"\n\nSecret Fortress of the Kwantung Army 2\n\nWhen I pressed Yingzi for details, she couldn't clarify, only that she had caught a fleeting glimpse of a child, seemingly a little girl, but she wasn't certain. She hadn't seen the clothes clearly, just a figure, about five or six, maybe seven years old. The direction the child ran was exactly where the map indicated an exit.\n\nThe passage was no more than two meters away from me. In such a silent place, it would be impossible not to hear a child running past. So noiselessly, it could only be a specter. The underground fortress was a world cut off from the outside, untouched for decades. Who knew what was hidden within? Today's events had already taken their toll on us. Better to avoid more trouble\u2014when you can't confront something, isn't it better to evade it?\n\nI suggested we take a longer route to the fortress exit, avoiding the passage the child had run through.\n\nYingzi, who was most fearful of ghosts and spirits, nodded in agreement. \"Climbing ten more miles is better than running into a ghost-built wall.\"\n\nFatty was skeptical. \"Old Hu, I've noticed you've changed. Ever since you were demobilized from the army, you're not as fearless as before. It's not like you to shy away. Now, just because Yingzi saw a child, you want to take a detour? Let me tell you, if you want to go the long way around, you two go ahead. I can't walk that much anymore. I'll take the shortcut.\" He reminisced about our days as Red Guards, going up to the mountains and down to the countryside. \"Back then, what were you ever afraid of? Over those years, who did we ever yield to?\"\n\n I found myself at a loss for words, as if what Fatty had said was true. In the past, I was the type to use the falling sky as a blanket. But since enlisting in the army, all the way through China's Counterattack in Self-Defense Against Vietnam, I witnessed comrades-in-arms fall one after another. I've seen bloodshed and death time and again. To be frank, I have indeed become somewhat overcautious, always looking before I leap. Could it be that the passage of years has indeed swept away my courage and audacity?\n\nI said to Fatty, \"How old are we now? We can't compare to the past. When we were Red Guards, we were indeed fierce and ruthless, ready to fight anyone who crossed us. But that was a ridiculous era, and looking back now, it all seems both laughable and tragic.\"\n\nFatty replied, \"But at least in that era, you fought and charged. I can't stand to see you all jittery now. Do you remember the long poem I wrote in the notebook I gave you for your sixteenth birthday?\"\n\nThat notebook was probably long gone by now. Over the years, Fatty had given me many notebooks since his mother worked at a government logistics agency and had all sorts of notebooks at home. I really couldn't recall any long poem.\n\nSeeing that I couldn't remember, Fatty decided to recite a few lines for me. His Mandarin was impeccable, and his voice, deep and resonant, carried the authority of a national radio broadcaster. He began to recite with fervor:\n\n\"Together in the park, we played at guerrillas, side by side in class, we read our books. On Xianyang Road, we smashed the 'Four Olds', and together we joined the grand link-up at Jinggangshan.\n\nOn the eve of burying imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, before marching into the world, by the radio, we listened intently, to the Ministry of National Defense's declaration of war, each word and phrase.\"\n\nAfter Fatty's impassioned start, I immediately remembered. It was a narrative long poem titled \"A Salute to the Warriors in the Third World War,\" widely circulated among the Red Guards. We knew it too well. When we were Red Guards, how many times had we recited it together? Hundreds, thousands. It was our favorite rhythm, our dearest words, our most youthful and magnificent dreams. My emotions were stirred, and forgetting where I was, I clenched my fists and joined him, reciting in unison:\n\n\"On that unforgettable night, the longing for battle coursed through every vein.\n\nOur fathers' fervor inspired us, thrilling our hearts. We are the offspring of soldiers, destined to gallop through the flames and gun smoke.\"\n\n During the Third World War, which sought to eradicate the last vestiges of exploitation, we were assigned to the same unit.\n\nOur friendship began there, its duration beyond reckoning, only knowing it surpassed mountains in height and outstretched roads in length.\n\nIn the trenches, we shared a loaf of bread, licked a handful of salt together.\n\nHumming the same tune, we were covered by the same military blanket.\n\nWord by word, line by line, we repeatedly studied the thoughts of our leader, the great truths.\n\nBeneath the red flag, with sincere devotion to the Party and a fervent desire to dedicate ourselves,\n\nWe gripped our rifles, raised our fists, and made an ironclad vow: we were willing to give our all for the cause.\n\nIn the blaze of artillery fire, we advanced shoulder to shoulder, storming the enemy's three-hundred-meter line,\n\nOur submachine guns spewing the proletariat's vengeance in bullets.\n\nDo you remember how we drank from the waters of the Don, crossed the Ukrainian grasslands, scaled the Ural Plateau, and rekindled the red star atop the Kremlin?\n\nWe followed the footsteps of the Commune, through the streets and alleys of Paris, charged through every town, village, and harbor of Europa to the rhythm of \"The Internationale.\"\n\nWe used Jerusalem's Wailing Wall to block the venomous bullets of Christians, planting the red flag on the banks of the Suez.\n\nThe shimmering lakes of Switzerland, the lights of Pisa, the twilight of Yemen, the temples of Phnom Penh, the cherry blossoms of Mount Fuji, the hearth smoke of Havana, the red wine of Spain, the clear springs of Black Africa,\n\nAll these never tempted us to linger.\n\nFor we each had a steel gun in hand, a heavy responsibility on our shoulders.\n\nCountless sleepless days and nights, countless blood-soaked campaigns from south to north.\n\nThus, our invincible ranks followed the red sun, pressing forward without end.\n\nListen: the call of brothers from all continents, like a surging torrent, a mighty roar.\n\nLook: the flags of liberty of slaves from all seas, like sparks setting the prairie ablaze.\n\nAh, the world is awash in red, with only the White House remaining a speck.\n\nThree red flares rise in the night sky, you pat my shoulder: \"Comrade, do you remember the words of a Politburo member on the battlefield in America, seeing the fervor of the children, the world's friends rejoicing at the prospect of liberation, the expectant eyes of the old Red Army of the Soviet Union?\"\n\nRemember, this is the final struggle, the decisive battle for the fate of humanity is today.\n\nThe bugle has sounded, our hearts united in resolve, we charge forward like a gale.\n\nOne hand holds a green leaf, the other a poisoned arrow, this brass eagle emblem that has dominated for two centuries,\n\nIs cast into the roaring flames amidst the victorious cheers of the people.\n\nYingzi, seeing us talk endlessly and not understanding a word, grows impatient and interrupts: \"What are you two going on about so animatedly? It's getting late; no matter which path we take, it's time to set off. If you wish to continue, you can do so once we're outside, alright?\"\n\nFatty picks up his Type 100 submachine gun, tucks several magazines into his belt, his expression resolute, and gestures forward: \"Comrades, victory lies ahead. Follow me.\"\n\n Thus, Fatty took the lead, Yingzi held the middle, and I brought up the rear. In single file, the three of us advanced towards the passage where Yingzi had seen the child run through. It was a gently sloping path that, after a hundred meters or so, transformed into ascending steps, indicating that we were venturing into the hillsides of Wildman Gully.\n\nThe passage narrowed as we went, and the humidity increased significantly, making breathing laborious and lending an oppressive sensation akin to being buried alive.\n\nWe were close together when, without warning, Fatty halted in his tracks. Caught off guard, Yingzi, following directly behind, collided with his back. The impact sent Yingzi tumbling backward down the steps, but I quickly reached out to steady her. \"What's going on? Why did you suddenly stop?\" I asked Fatty.\n\nFatty turned around and shouted, \"Run back! Run!\" His voice had changed, tinged with terror, the bravado from earlier completely dissipated.\n\nSecret Fortress of the Kwantung Army 3\n\nFatty was urging us to flee for our lives. From behind the other two, my flashlight's limited range couldn't reveal much, but I could make out a large open space at the top of four or five steps ahead. Uncertain of what he had seen, I nevertheless trusted Fatty's instinct and prepared to retreat.\n\nSimultaneously, I felt dozens of icy needles piercing my back, a chill penetrating to the bone, as if struck by a frigid electric current. My body shuddered uncontrollably, and with a sudden burst of strength, I leaped forward, pushing both Fatty and Yingzi ahead of me. We tumbled and rolled up the inclined, gloomy corridor, crashing into the cavity at the stairway's end.\n\nMysteriously electrified, it seemed the current had also spread to the others, leaving us all quaking and teeth chattering, none of us understanding what had just happened. We tried to speak but found no voice. If it were an accidental brush with a live wire, one would expect numbness, not this bone-deep, outward radiating cold.\n\nFortunately, the three loaded submachine guns we carried did not discharge in the chaos. Lying on the ground, our flashlights still on, the beams revealed why Fatty had turned to run. We were in a vast stone chamber, half natural, half man-made, covered in green moss. The damp stone walls and ceiling were festooned with countless enormous bats, far larger than any ordinary bats we'd seen. Disturbed by our intrusion, they awoke from their slumber, unfurling their wings and revealing rows of white, fearsome tusks that made one's scalp tingle at the sight.\n\n Bat had a peculiar face, with two diamond-shaped ears standing erect, a round head, and a round nose. His limbs were remarkably long, with elongated upper arms, forearms, metacarpals, and phalanges. His teeth and claws were sharp and deadly. During my time as a combat engineer in the Kunlun Mountains, I encountered such large bats. Known scientifically as Macroderma gigas, also called the ghost bat, they are a bloodthirsty and carnivorous species, one of the most ferocious among bats. They prefer to dwell in the subterranean caverns of grasslands in pastoral regions, emerging at night to prey on livestock such as cattle and sheep. Especially in the grasslands of Outer Mongolia, they once caused great trouble, but sightings of these creatures have been rare over the past decade or so.\n\nI had thought them extinct, yet here was a multitude of ghost bats making their lair in an abandoned underground fortress of the Kwantung Army. They roosted by day and ventured out at night, using the fortress's ventilation holes as exits\u2014a nest more secure and comfortable than any other.\n\nSeveral ghost bats had already taken flight from the stone walls. I struggled to rise, but as I pushed off the ground, I slipped on a mixture of bat guano and animal remains. The stench was overpowering, and the ground was sticky and slick. Bat guano, also known as saltpeter, is a highly prized ingredient in traditional medicine. Hard to come by in small quantities, it was utterly repulsive to see it in such abundance.\n\nAbandoning the effort to stand, I curled my finger around the trigger of my Type 100 submachine gun and opened fire on the approaching ghost bats. As I began shooting, the other two regained their senses, and our three submachine guns created a crisscrossing barrage. The muzzle flashes and the streaks of bullets lit up the stone cave in alternating brightness and shadow, while the cacophony of gunfire, the clinking of ejected casings, and the thud of spent shells hitting the ground melded together.\n\nThousands of ghost bats were now in tumult, these creatures of darkness terrified of fire and light. Aside from those struck by bullets and plummeting to the ground, the rest swarmed like dark clouds\u2014some flying over our heads, others scrambling up through the ventilation holes.\n\nOur submachine gun bullets were quickly expended, with no time to reload. The ghost bats whizzed past, their sharp claws and tusks tearing our clothes into shreds. Fortunately, our thick attire prevented deep wounds, though some scratches did break the skin.\n\nFear gripped me more than the physical pain. I was terrified of losing my eyesight and dared not open my eyes. With one hand shielding my head and face, I wielded the submachine gun with the other, swinging it wildly as if it were a club, while my legs kicked frantically to fend off the ghost bats diving at me.\n\n Time had become a blur when the cave finally quieted down, presumably as the pig-faced Large Bats had all fled. Fumbling for the flashlight that had fallen to the ground, I was about to call out to Fatty and the others to check if they were injured.\n\nSuddenly, darkness loomed before me as the largest of the pig-faced Large Bats descended silently towards my head. It must have been the leader of the cave's bat population, having concealed itself in the deepest recesses of the Stone Cave. Now, it made its late appearance, its wings unfurling to fill the entire wall.\n\nArmed with nothing more than an empty gun and a flashlight, I was defenseless. The beast was mere inches away, its porcine face with its layers of wrinkled skin and hard bristles and tusks was terrifyingly clear. Just as I was about to be bitten by the Large Bat, a burst of submachine gun fire erupted from beside me. A volley of bullets struck the pig-faced Large Bat, which fell to the ground with a few final flutters and died.\n\nIt turned out that Fatty, sensing the urgency of the situation, had reloaded and opened fire, saving my life. I exhaled deeply and surveyed our surroundings. Apart from a few Large Bats on the ground that had been shot and were still struggling, there were no other hidden Bats left.\n\nSeveral gashes on my body were bleeding profusely. Yingzi and Fatty too had sustained minor injuries, but nothing serious. Yingzi tore some strips of cloth from her clothing to bandage my wounds.\n\nThe pain from my injuries was intense, and I couldn't help but curse. Back in my days on the front lines, amidst the hail of bullets, I hadn't suffered a scratch, and now these beasts had torn so many gashes in me\u2014it was excruciating.\n\nFatty asked me, \"Old Hu, when I told you guys to run back just now, why did you end up pushing us further in?\"\n\nI recounted the incident but only mentioned that my back might have brushed against some exposed wires and received an electric shock. I didn't dare tell them the truth because even I found it unbelievable. I asked Yingzi to check my back for burns. When Yingzi pulled back my shirt and shone the flashlight on it, she exclaimed, \"Oh my goodness, Brother Hu, what happened to you? This doesn't look like an electric burn.\"\n\nFatty also leaned in to inspect my back: \"You've been electrocuted? There's a black handprint on your back, but it's small, like that of a child.\"\n\nDamn it, it was as if we'd encountered a real ghost. It seemed we were pushed into this Bat Cave by that little ghost. \"Don't let me see it,\" I muttered, \"if I do, I'll skin it alive.\"\n\nJust as Fatty was about to speak, his flashlight dropped to the ground: \"Oh my god, Old Hu, Yingzi, back at the Gena Warehouse, I didn't believe you, but now I've seen a child run past too.\"\n\n Yingzi and I hastily grabbed our flashlights and shone them around, but aside from bat droppings and carcasses, there were no signs of any child.\n\nFatty swore to the heavens, \"You all saw him run behind you, I'd be lying if I were your grandson. He ran inwards, I saw it clearly\u2014a little boy, just a kid, wearing green, about five or six years old, with an unusually pale face, not like a living person.\"\n\nApart from me, they had all seen a child in this underground fortress. Why was it that only I hadn't seen him? Yet, the handprint of the child I had felt on my back was undeniably chilling. Fatty claimed to have seen a boy, while Yingzi insisted it was a little girl she saw in the Gena Warehouse. Who was mistaken, or was this underground fortress running a nursery?\n\nWe tidied up a bit and stood up, loading new magazines into our submachine guns. Fatty pointed to a wall of the stone chamber, \"That little rascal ran right in here.\" After saying so, he used the butt of his gun to scrape away the moss and bat droppings on the wall, revealing a half-covered iron door, its surface mottled with rust and emblazoned with four striking characters in dark red paint: No Entry Allowed.\n\n\"Secret Fortress of the Kwantung Army 4.\"\n\nForbidden Child read aloud the characters on the door and then said to us, \"Do you know what this means? It's saying you can't walk in, if you want to enter, you have to lie down\u2014probably a morgue or a cremation furnace.\"\n\nUpon hearing Fatty's explanation, Yingzi commented, \"So 'No Entry Allowed' is meant for the dead. I've heard the elders in the village talk about these ghostly cremation furnaces\u2014this iron door must lead to one.\"\n\nI rapped on the iron door with my knuckles, feeling its heft, \"Fatty, don't pretend to know what you don't. These four characters likely mean 'entry prohibited.' Although I'm not versed in Japanese, I'm quite familiar with military facilities. Look here, there's a large recess at the bottom of the door with inner hexagonal gong patterns; it must require a turntable to open this door. The hole at the bottom is an exhaust groove; this is an airtight door. When the door is closed, the exhaust vent automatically sucks out the air from inside, creating a semi-vacuum environment. It's a place for storing valuable items. Our military bases have similar facilities.\"\n\n The airtight door's wheel had long been dismantled, and without the proper tools, prying open this iron gate was as daunting as scaling the azure heavens. As for what lay within the Secret Chamber, that was anyone's guess. It was quite likely to house items such as Chemical Weapons or Bacterial Weapons, given that such hazardous materials were typically stored in Sealed Secret Chambers to prevent accidental leaks.\n\nJapanese Chemical and Bacterial Weapons, notorious though they were, should not be underestimated. Even after many years in the natural environment, they retained their lethal potency. However, I had no interest in the contents behind that door. Consulting the map to swiftly locate an exit seemed the more prudent course of action.\n\nFatty, on the other hand, was brimming with curiosity about the door, especially after I mentioned the possibility of valuable items being stored behind it. His interest piqued, he and Yingzi took turns knocking and kicking at the door, their behavior suggesting an unyielding resolve to see what lay beyond. They murmured to each other in frustration, \"What treasures could be inside? Ah, it's so aggravating not to be able to see.\"\n\nI paid them no further mind, instead focusing on matching the map to the exit within this Stone Cave, once the dominion of the pig-faced Large Bats. According to the topography depicted on the map, there should be a Small Passage within this cave that led to an exit at the mountain's peak.\n\nYet, despite my searching, I found only a massive pile of collapsed boulders at one end of the Stone Cave. As expected, the Japanese Army had demolished the Fortress's exits during their retreat.\n\nOur current position was directly beneath the spot where we had pitched our tents on the slopes of Wildman Gully. Shining a flashlight upwards revealed several large holes in the cave's ceiling. These sizable ventilation shafts were not straight but twisted and turned to prevent external attacks. It was through these openings that the Bats took flight. Alas, we lacked Wings, and even if we could reach them, it would be futile; the ventilation holes were crafted just small enough to prevent an adult's passage. The Little Japanese had been cunning, fearing enemies might crawl through these shafts into the Fortress, they had designed the openings to be neither too large nor too small.\n\nI called Fatty and Yingzi over to inform them that the exit was blocked. We had two choices: either search for another way out or take our Submachine Guns back to the ancient tomb and eliminate the Corpse Demon. We couldn't afford to waste time here; we had no provisions and had seen no sign of food within the Ghostly Fortress. If we continued aimlessly, we would eventually be too weak to crawl, leaving us nothing but to await death.\n\n The situation was clear: the underground fortress extended deep and wide, spanning dozens of kilometers. Walking from one exit to another would take a considerable amount of time, and searching for another exit was now pointless. The Japanese wouldn't have kindly left an exit open; if they had collapsed one, the rest were surely destroyed as well.\n\nYingzi kicked the corpse of a large bat on the ground: \"If it really comes down to it, we could eat this thing. It's all meat.\"\n\nFatty shook his head vigorously: \"You guys can eat it if you want to. I'd rather starve than touch that. It's damn disgusting. I bet the meat is either rotten or sour, and definitely not palatable. By the way, Old Hu, do you think the exit might be behind that iron door? It seems possible. Let's find a way to open it and see.\"\n\nAfter some thought, I said, \"That possibility does exist. The secret chamber isn't marked on the map, only a passage that leads to an exit. But it's hard to pinpoint the location accurately, and we can't be sure that the passage is behind that door. Opening the door isn't difficult, though. I saw some tools in the Gena Warehouse; we can go find a hexagonal wrench of the right size.\"\n\nYingzi chimed in: \"Going back to the Gena Warehouse is perfect for grabbing some clothes to change into. Just look at the state of us three, we're filthy enough for fifteen people to stare at for half a month.\"\n\nHer reminder made us realize just how dirty we had become. Our clothes, hair, faces, and hands were all smothered with the overpowering stench of bat dung.\n\nWe then made our way back to the lower-level Gena Warehouse, which was only a few hundred meters away. At the Gena Warehouse, we first found some Kwantung Army military uniforms and coats to change into, wiping the dirt and bloodstains from our faces as best we could. Each of us also picked out a steel helmet to buckle onto our heads.\n\nYingzi, naturally handsome, looked even more striking in the military attire. Fatty applauded her appearance: \"Girl, you in that Japanese military uniform, you're the spitting image of Yoshiko Kawashima.\"\n\n Yingzi had no idea who Yoshiko Kawashima was and mistook Fatty's words for a compliment, basking in the praise. I had to tell Yingzi, \"He's saying you resemble a Japanese female spy.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Yingzi's eyebrows shot up in indignation, and Fatty quickly corrected himself, \"I misspoke, I misspoke. What I meant was that seeing Yingzi in military attire, armed with a rifle, reminds me of the poem: 'At dawn, the drill grounds gleam, a striking figure with a five-foot gun, the children of China possess remarkable ambitions, eschewing rouge for the love of arms.'\"\n\nLaughing, I added, \"Fatty's practically a poet these days, always ready to recite a few lines. Look at us now, in these outfits, we're just like the Japanese devils. This reminds me of a story told by one of my father's old comrades-in-arms. I was just a kid back then. My uncle, who had served with my father in Shandong with the Eighth Route Army, recounted that after the victory, they received instructions from the Central Party Committee to sail from the Jiaodong Peninsula to the Northeast to receive the fruits of victory. My father couldn't go because he got seasick and regretted it deeply, especially after hearing how the Northeast was full of foreign goods. My uncle said that when they arrived in the Northeast, they found a treasure trove of Japanese goods. His whole unit, dressed in tatters like a band of beggars, ended up taking over a Kwantung Army warehouse from the Russians. They all got new outfits; aside from the Chinese flag, everything from their clothes to their shoes and weapons was Japanese, identical to the Kwantung Army. The locals, seeing them from a distance, turned tail and ran, thinking the ghosts had returned. I feel like we now share a bit of the sensation our revolutionary forebears had when they picked up those foreign leftovers.\"\n\nAs I spoke, I found a hexagonal wrench on a shelf storing gasoline drums: \"Now we're all set, we've got everything we need. Let's move out quickly.\"\n\nThe three of us, dressed in Kwantung Army uniforms and carrying Type 100 Submachine Guns, retraced our steps. I covered the rear again, and this time, Fatty and the others didn't mention seeing any shadowy figures of children. I didn't ask, but shadows of doubt and ghosts of suspicion flickered through my mind.\n\n Inwardly, I mused: Fatty said the child ran into the iron gate. What exactly is this little ghost up to? Is it trying to show us the way out? Could we be so lucky? Or does it have other schemes in mind? Damn it, I still have a bit of glutinous rice left. It's said that ghosts fear glutinous rice. If that little ghost dares to cause trouble, I'll make sure it regrets coming and ensure its hasty retreat. Otherwise, it wouldn't showcase Old Hu's skills.\n\nAs I walked alongside them, I bolstered my confidence. The wound on my back seemed to hurt less. Before long, we arrived for the second time at the stone cave with the airtight door.\n\nTo be safe, we all donned steel helmets and gas masks, pulled back the gun bolts, and chambered the bullets. Before opening the door, I had Yingzi grab a handful of glutinous rice ready to scatter and instructed Fatty to aim the submachine gun, ready to shoot anything that might be inside the door without hesitation. Additionally, I advised Fatty to coordinate with me, taking turns firing to avoid any gaps in reloading magazines.\n\nOnce everything was arranged, I slung the submachine gun over my shoulder, clutched the hexagonal wrench onto the door's rusted threads, and turned with all my might. The secret door hadn't been opened for decades, and the threads were rusted solid.\n\nI exerted all my strength, nearly breaking the wrench, until finally, I heard the creaking and groaning of metal, and with a hiss, the three exhaust grooves beneath the door allowed air to fill the airtight chamber, and the iron door began to crack and creak open.\n\nSecret Fortress of the Kwantung Army 5\n\nAs the air slots in the airtight door filled with air, the heavy iron door swung open. I hastily stepped back two paces, raised my submachine gun and flashlight to the doorway, but inside, all was eerily still.\n\nThe situation was unexpected. Beyond the door lay impenetrable darkness, and the beam of the flashlight seemed to be devoured by the blackness inside.\n\nI signaled to Yingzi, who understood and scattered a handful of glutinous rice into the secret chamber like a celestial maiden casting flowers. Yet still, the secret chamber remained silent, as if all the sounds in the world had vanished, leaving only the heavy breathing from within my gas mask.\n\nIt seemed we had been overly cautious. As the saying goes, suspicion breeds phantoms, and before anything had even happened, we had scared ourselves half to death.\n\nUnable to contain himself any longer, Fatty took the lead and entered the secret chamber, with Yingzi and me following closely, filing in one after another.\n\n The Secret Chamber was a solitary room, roughly forty square meters in size, with no other exits save for an airtight door.\n\nWhat it contained was neither bacterial nor chemical weapons. Before entering, I had conjured up every possibility, except for what actually lay before us\u2014more than a dozen large coffins haphazardly strewn about the Secret Chamber. Time had eaten away at these coffins; some were rotting, varying in size, craftsmanship, and style, including an enormous stone coffin. The most luxurious among them were two made of Phoebe Nanmu, a type of precious wood, and the ground was littered with countless shards of pottery and porcelain.\n\nI turned to look at Fatty and the others; they shook their heads at me, their faces a picture of bewilderment, even behind their gas masks.\n\nFatty asked me, \"Old Hu, what's going on? It's like a museum. Where did all these coffins come from?\"\n\nAfter a moment's thought, the answer wasn't hard to deduce, though our preconceived notions had blinded us to it.\n\nWildman Gully was originally an ancient tomb cluster from the Jin-Liao period. When the Kwantung Army constructed this secret underground fortress, particularly the three passages connecting the two sides of the fortress that cut right through the valley of Wildman Gully, they must have unearthed a number of ancient tombs during the construction. The burial artifacts and coffins of the Jin-Liao nobility were treasures to the Japanese. They stored everything excavated from the tombs in this semi-vacuum Secret Chamber. The Kwantung Army's retreat was hasty; they only managed to roll up and take the antique burial objects, leaving these coffins behind.\n\nFatty remarked, \"The Japanese sure knew how to take advantage of a situation, leaving nothing behind for us. Let's see if there's anything valuable left inside these coffins. It would make this trip worthwhile.\" With that, he kicked open the lid of a large coffin. The lid had already been pried open by the Japanese and was not nailed back on; a single kick sent it clattering to the side.\n\nYingzi, a personal name, didn't dare come over to look. \"I'll wait for you two at the door. I'll keep watch, make sure no one locks us all in here,\" she said, then walked to the doorway, standing with one foot inside and the other out, guarding the entrance.\n\nI called out to Yingzi at the door, \"You're always so astute, big sister. I hadn't even considered that. After all these years as a soldier, it's embarrassing to admit. This door can only be opened from the outside. If we were all trapped in this Secret Chamber, we'd be in quite a predicament, with no tears enough to find a way out.\"\n\n Fatty was rummaging through the coffin with reckless abandon, cursing as he went: \"Nothing but bone fragments; those Japanese devils really had no decency, implementing their 'Three Alls Policy' wherever they went, not even leaving a single intact jar behind for us.\"\n\nAfter turning over three or four coffins to the same end, Fatty was cursing nonstop, then he went to push against a vermilion lacquered coffin made of precious Phoebe nanmu wood.\n\nI didn't pay much attention to the ordinary coffins; my gaze was constantly drawn to a massive stone coffin. Intuition told me there was something inside.\n\nI couldn't understand why I felt this way, but suddenly I was overwhelmed with the urge to open the stone coffin. I called Fatty over to help, and together we pushed against the slab of stone on top. It was exceptionally heavy, and after much effort, we only managed to create a narrow gap.\n\nPanting heavily, Fatty waved his hand: \"Let's take a break; it's too heavy. I can't push without something in my stomach.\"\n\nMy own stomach was growling with hunger, and exerting myself only made stars dance before my eyes, so I sat down to rest as well. We took off our gas masks and each lit a cigarette.\n\nBlowing out a ring of smoke, Fatty said: \"Old Hu, do you think the ancients had water in their brains? Making a coffin out of stone, I've never seen anyone use stone for a coffin before.\"\n\nI stroked the stone slab and said: \"This isn't just a coffin; it's a stone sarcophagus. Coffin, coffin\u2014the wooden coffin is inside this stone chest. Whoever enjoyed such a burial was certainly high-ranking, perhaps even a prince.\"\n\nScratching his head, Fatty said: \"I see, it's quite complex. We're all buried in Wildman Gully, but compared to the one we dug up, the general's tomb, who had a higher rank, the occupant of this stone coffin or the general?\"\n\nI shook my head: \"Hard to say, we're not well-versed in history. But during the several hundred years of the Jin, Liao, and Yuan dynasties, the nomadic tribes of the north were unprecedentedly powerful. They won their empires from horseback, so I suspect it was those with the highest military honors who were buried in this prime feng shui treasure land. The nobles buried nearby might have burial artifacts even richer than those in the general's tomb. The tomb master's personal tastes in life varied, so the burial artifacts would certainly differ. Take the ancient tomb we excavated; the tomb master was a mere warrior, lacking in sophisticated taste and artistic appreciation, which is why the items in his tomb were mostly horses and weapons.\"\n\n Fatty remarked, \"Actually, those horses must have been exceptional breeds, worth a fortune if they were still alive. But now, only their bones remain, which I bet even the scrapyard wouldn't want. It's a good thing he still had two jade bi discs; otherwise, we would've been toiling in vain. These two jade bi discs can be taken to Big Gold Tooth to find a buyer. At the very least, they should fetch a tidy sum.\"\n\nAs we finished speaking, our cigarettes had burned down to the filters. We donned our gas masks once more, braced ourselves, and pushed the massive stone slab again. Yingzi came over to help, and at last, we managed to move the slab aside, revealing a coffin of pure black beneath. This coffin was nearly twice the size of an ordinary one and unusually tall. Not counting the arched lid, it stood more than half a person tall.\n\nThe craftsmanship of the coffin was exquisite, far from ordinary. Around both ends and the sides of the lid were colorful, gold-trimmed paintings of auspicious mythical beasts\u2014cranes, qilins, turtles, and snakes\u2014all intended to bless the person within, that they might ascend to immortality after death. The lid also bore a celestial map of the twenty-eight constellations, and a ring of cloud patterns adorned the base of the coffin in gold. Whatever secret technique was used, the colors remained as vibrant as if new, even after centuries, truly a sight to behold.\n\nWe had never before seen such a lavishly magnificent coffin. Had we not witnessed it with our own eyes, we could never have imagined that such an artful and grand casket existed in the world.\n\nFatty was overjoyed, \"Even if there's nothing inside, we could make a fortune just by selling this coffin.\" He rolled up his sleeves and slid the coffin lid open.\n\nEven Yingzi couldn't resist the urge to see what lay within this great coffin. The three of us gathered around, shining our flashlights inside. The brocade silk lining had long since decayed, likely to turn to ash upon touch. Resting atop the layers of rotten fabric was a skeleton, its flesh and clothing disintegrated over the millennia, leaving only the skull somewhat intact, its jaws wide open, revealing two rows of black, decayed teeth. Much of the skeleton had disintegrated into the air, and without the skull, it might have been impossible to discern that these were human remains.\n\nYingzi swept the beam of her flashlight along the edge of the giant coffin and screamed in shock, \"Oh my goodness, it's the children!\"\n\nAt each end of the coffin stood a naked boy and girl, looking to be about five or six years old, lifelike in appearance. The boy had a topknot while the girl's hair was done up in two buns\u2014a style far from modern, more akin to ancient figures in wall paintings. Could they be the sacrificial boy and girl servants meant to accompany the master of the coffin in death? With the master almost completely decomposed, how could these boy and girl servants have been preserved so perfectly?\n\nSecret Fortress of the Kwantung Army 6\n\n \"These two little brats are probably fakes, made to look so lifelike.\" As Fatty spoke, he reached out to pinch one of the children in the giant coffin. \"Today, old Fatty is going to see for himself if these little buggers have really become enchanted or what.\"\n\nI quickly grabbed Fatty's hand to stop him. \"Don't touch without gloves, it could be poisonous. Take a closer look at these kids' skin, it's all covered in patches of bluish-purple Mercury Blisters. That's Mercurial Sore.\"\n\nBack in the fifties, my grandfather, Hu Guohua, stayed in a major hospital in Beijing for a while due to an illness. During his stay, construction for the Workers' Stadium nearby was underway, and an ancient tomb was unearthed at the site. He sneaked out of the hospital to join the crowd and ventured into the Underground Palace for a look.\n\nThe tomb was said to belong to a prince from the Ming Dynasty, surrounded by a moat of dark water. The Underground Palace's Tomb Chamber was divided into three sections: front, middle, and rear. A Thousand Jin Gate hung at the entrance. Passing through the gate, one first entered a hall that mirrored the layout of the Tomb Master's family home, complete with various pieces of furniture, known as Burial Artifacts.\n\nFurther inside, the central Tomb Chamber, referred to as the resting hall, was where the Coffins were placed. This ancient tomb was a Joint Burial Tomb, and what was particularly special was that the coffins of the Tomb Master and his consort, the prince and princess, were suspended in mid-air, locked with Large Iron Chains, copper rings, and locks.\n\nThe rear section was the auxiliary chamber, specifically for storing Burial Artifacts.\n\nNot long after, another ancient tomb from the Yuan Dynasty was unearthed in Haidian, and both tombs contained the remains of Boy and Girl Servants who were buried alive. When excavated, they looked identical to living humans, except that the clothes on the boy and girl servants from the Yuan Dynasty tomb turned to ash upon touch.\n\nLater, my grandfather recounted these two events to me as stories. He said that while these Boy and Girl Servants were alive, in addition to ingesting mercury, they had holes drilled into the Top of the head, back, and soles of the feet, which were then filled with mercury. After death, their bodies were coated with Mercury Powder, turning them into specimens that, even after thousands of years, their flesh did not decay. This technique was far more advanced than the mummies of ancient Egypt. However, the two civilizations had different backgrounds and Value Orientations. Moreover, to preserve the appearance of a corpse using Mercury Injection, living subjects were required, as the blood circulation in a deceased could not facilitate the infusion, which is why this technique was never used on any Tomb Master.\n\n Perhaps the cruelest act in the world is to bury the living with the dead. Fatty, donning gloves, lifted the body of one of the children, examining it closely. Indeed, atop the head, on the back, and under the feet, several holes were revealed. These openings in the bodies had been carefully sealed by skilled craftsmen using fire lacquer. Many areas on the corpses displayed patches of black and purple pockmarks. Burial companions or gold, silver, and jade artifacts were often coated with mercury powder, which, over time, would undergo chemical changes. In more recent cases, the color would appear as a reddish-brown, while in older instances, it would turn black and purple. These mercury blisters were commonly known as mercurial sores or mercury soaks, and in some places, the term for the corpse's condition was 'rotten yinzi', a term for mercury sulfide.\n\nFatty was clearly a bit nervous. Attempting to appear calm, he sighed and said, \"I've read about mercury soaks on antiques in Lu Xun's writings. It seems that the old fellow didn't just make it up; there is truth to it.\"\n\nYingzi inquired, \"This is just too pitiful. Hu Ge, why haven't they dressed these boy and girl servants? I remember the child I saw running by earlier was wearing clothes. Could it be a ghost's spirit?\"\n\nI told her, \"Only they themselves would know if they are spirits. But it's not that these two children are undressed. Burial objects, including boy and girl servants, would have certainly been dressed in finery. After nearly a thousand years, by now, those clothes would have rotted away. After so many years, this giant coffin is likely from the Yuan Dynasty. The moment the Kwantung Army unearthed and opened this large casket, the clothes would have turned to dust upon contact with the air.\"\n\nI never believed in ghosts, but sometimes the ironclad facts before you leave no room for doubt. Fatty and Yingzi saw the figure of a child in the passageway, identical to the pair of boy and girl servants buried with the coffin. And then there was the handprint on my back. The facts here were beyond human comprehension. Perhaps one could explain it as a sixth sense response, a premonition, or the like. In any case, all these belonged to natural phenomena. With our limited understanding, we could only catch a glimpse into the shadows of this mysterious and unfathomable unknown world.\n\nHowever, the spirits of these two children led us here, seemingly without any malicious intent.\n\nYingzi said, \"Maybe they want us to give them a proper burial. It's often said that being buried brings peace. Why don't we help them? It's so very sad.\"\n\n Fatty nodded in agreement, \"I'm only in it for the treasure, not to meddle in sundry matters, but this time the situation is special. Let's do a good deed and bury them properly, rather than leaving them exposed like this. They've stood guard for the Tomb Master for a millennium; it's time for them to rest.\"\n\n\"The bodies are filled with mercury; they can't be burnt away. All we can do is dig a grave and bury them, hoping the world will see fewer such tragedies.\"\n\nWithout further delay, Fatty and I took off the Kwantung Army Greatcoats we were wearing, wrapped the Boy and Girl Servants in them, tied them up, and hoisted them onto our backs. The bodies, heavy with mercury, were dead weight. Thankfully, they were children; had they been adults, carrying even one would have been a struggle.\n\nSeeing no valuable treasure, Fatty was somewhat displeased, almost wishing to set all the coffins ablaze. Yingzi and I quickly dissuaded him, and he reluctantly gave up the idea.\n\nWe returned to the Stone Cave to discuss our escape. Hunger and thirst tormented us, and it was all the more frustrating that the Underground Fortress offered neither food nor water, and we had no explosives or shells. Our only way back to the surface was through the General's Tomb's robbery tunnel. But the thought of the Corpse Demon's monstrous strength gave us a headache; even well-fed, we might not be a match for it, let alone now, weakened by hunger.\n\nThe three of us exchanged glances, our thoughts aligning. With over a dozen Dead Bats on the ground, we had no choice but to consume these creatures to appease our hunger.\n\nHumans are omnivores by nature, and when driven by desperation, there's nothing we can't eat. Yingzi recounted how she had eaten bats with her grandfather in a cave deep within an ancient forest during her youth. A forest fire had coincided with a rare famine, driving away the larger animals. People resorted to eating ground mice, bats, locusts, and grasshoppers. She claimed that bat tendons and crunchy bones were quite tasty, with a satisfying chew.\n\nThe Large Bats in the Stone Cave, with their gaunt frames and sinister, ferocious appearances, looked like mummies of blood-sucking demons. Fatty and I were skeptical about the palatability of their flesh.\n\nBut survival trumped all, and we couldn't be choosy. To cook them, we'd have to return to the Gena Warehouse, where plenty of wooden crates could serve as firewood. Of course, coffin planks could also be burned, but the idea of eating meat roasted over coffin wood was somewhat unsettling. So Fatty used the rope he carried to pick out five or six plump Dead Bats, tied their feet together, strung them up, and dragged them along, including the sizable Bat King among them.\n\n After returning to the Gena Warehouse, I set aside the overcoat that was wrapped around the Boy and Girl Servants. Yingzi drew a short knife and cut off the Bat's ugly Head, its fleshless claws, and then proceeded to gut it, discarding the clumps of blue-grey intestines and the excess offal from the stomach of the pig-faced Large Bat. Finally, she carelessly skinned it.\n\nI found a large pile of wooden crates and kicked them into planks, then whittled some shavings with a knife. I struck a match to ignite the shavings, starting a fire with Fatty assisting by my side, squatting on the ground, rolling up his sleeves to blow on the flames, fanning them larger.\n\nWe found several bayonets from rifles to skewer the Bat and set it over the fire to roast. Fatty frowned, clearly reluctant to eat such a thing.\n\nYingzi encouraged him, \"It's not bad. Don't think of it as Bat. Chew it a bit more, and it'll taste just like mutton.\"\n\nI didn't mind. Isn't a Bat just like a rat? When the troops were on maneuvers in Shaanxi, I ate all sorts of rodents\u2014ground mice, dormice, flying squirrels, field mice, masked palm civets, and the like. They all tasted pretty similar, with layers of fat and lean meat that indeed resembled mutton. However, I had never tried Bat meat before.\n\nThe pig-faced Large Bat is a warm-blooded creature with not much fat, so it shouldn't be overcooked. Once the meat looked done, I tried a piece from the shoulder\u2014it was crispy, filled with sinew and cartilage, not as delicious as mutton but certainly chewy.\n\nSeeing me eat, Fatty also pinched his nose and took a bite, finding it quite satisfactory. He then devoured one whole, and still not satisfied, he skewered the largest Bat King on a bayonet to roast.\n\nWhen we had eaten about half, a string of sticky, glistening liquid dripped down from the roof right above Fatty's head, landing squarely on his face. Caught up in his feasting, Fatty felt his face wet and wiped it casually, exclaiming, \"How did so much drool end up on my head?\"\n\nSecret Fortress of the Kwantung Army 7\n\nFatty, with his mouth greased from eating, felt the dripping mucus land on his face. He cursed without thinking, \"How did so much drool end up on my head?\" As soon as he said it, he realized something was off.\n\nThere were only three of us in the Underground Fortress\u2014Yingzi and I were sitting opposite him. Even with all the skill in the world, we couldn't possibly drool on his head.\n\nAll three of us felt it strange and looked up simultaneously, wondering what could be dripping. The fire, fueled by the broken ammo crates and wooden planks, lit up the surroundings brightly. Beyond the reach of the firelight, darkness remained, a silent and lonely blackness.\n\n Above us, at the juncture of firelight and darkness on the rooftop, emerged an enormous human face, twice the size of an ordinary person's. It was so pale it seemed as if it had been smeared with flour, devoid of any expression, making it impossible to discern joy from anger. With a hooked nose and a pair of blood-red, strange eyes, it fixed its gaze intently on the roasted bat meat in Fatty's hand. Its lips were thick and large, protruding forward, and its gaping black maw was open, with half of its blood-red tongue hanging out, saliva nearly forming a river, dripping down in a steady stream.\n\nThe owner of that face had a long neck, with skin both dark and tough. Due to the high ceiling of the underground Gena Warehouse, the rest of its body was concealed in darkness, leaving only its face and a portion of its neck visible. It seemed very interested in the roasted bat meat we were eating, as if it wanted to swoop down and snatch it away, yet it hesitated, fearful of the flames burning below.\n\nHowever, it appeared that the aroma of the roasted meat was too tempting to resist, and it looked as if it could no longer contain itself, ready to leap down from the inverted roof at any moment.\n\nAs the three of us looked up, we were both startled and amazed. Although I had no knowledge of this creature's origins, I could tell that it wanted the roasted bat meat.\n\nWe had brought a total of five large bats from the Stone Cave. Yingzi and I had each eaten half, while Fatty had consumed one whole bat by himself, leaving three remaining. Fatty had divided the largest bat, the Bat King, into three parts, skewering one portion on the bayonet of his rifle, now roasting it over the fire.\n\nThis pig-faced Bat King, who knows how many centuries it had lived, was frighteningly large. Not counting its wings, its body alone was the size of a five or six-year-old child, and quite hefty. Our fire for roasting the meat was small, and even after dividing the Bat King into three parts, we could only roast one at a time. Thus, only the bat meat in Fatty's hands was eighty percent done, with the rest being uncooked, dead bats.\n\nBut in this urgent moment, there was no time for further thought. Seeing Fatty petrified by the expressionless face above, I quickly snatched the bayonet with the skewered roasted bat meat from his hands, waved it in front of the monstrous face, and then flung it aside with force.\n\nI had used too much strength, and instead of throwing it far, the bat meat was flung off the bayonet, landing not far behind Yingzi. Before Yingzi could even turn to look, a massive beast leaped down from the roof, pounced on the roasted Bat King, and, without even chewing, swallowed it whole.\n\n Illuminated by the firelight, we could see it clearly: the creature was not human. Its face resembled that of a baboon, strikingly human-like, with an exceedingly long neck. Its body was the size and shape of a bear, yet it lacked the bear's clumsiness. In contrast, its build seemed somewhat flattened. Its hind legs were bow-shaped, short and thick, while its forelimbs were unusually long. When it moved, it could grasp the crevices in the walls and hang there, its movements more at ease scaling the walls than on flat ground.\n\nYingzi had never seen such an animal, but Fatty and I had come across its picture before. As soon as it revealed its full appearance, we immediately recognized it: the Giant Ground Sloth, no doubt about it.\n\nThis creature dwelled in subterranean caverns deep within the grasslands, predominantly found on the great grasslands beyond southern America and Africa. Despite both being sloths, the Giant Ground Sloth was quite different from the jungle-dwelling sloths, and even more so from its distant relative, the tree sloth. The Giant Ground Sloth bore more traits of its ancestral Ice Age forebears, notably larger in size and primarily carnivorous. It seldom ventured out into the sunlight, preferring to prey on Large Bats, giant ground rats, pythons, and other subterranean animals.\n\nThe hunting method of the Giant Ground Sloth was one of stillness conquering motion. It rarely initiated attack, instead lying in wait in the darkness, motionless, sometimes for days on end without food or drink. When an animal passed by, it would strike like lightning, extending its gaping maw to consume its prey in one bite.\n\nIn the early days of the nation, an African brother country had gifted one to the Beijing Zoo. However, the animal did not adapt well to the Beijing environment and died not long after. Fatty, some classmates, and I, during our trip to Beijing to meet with the victorious Red Guards, were taken on a chaotic tour of the city, which included the zoo. There, we saw the enormous cage that once housed the Giant Ground Sloth. The creature was gone, leaving behind an empty cage. We found the sight of the massive, vacant enclosure somewhat odd, and gave it a few extra glances. An introduction and images of the creature adorned the cage.\n\nYears had passed, and the memory of this event remained vivid. But we never imagined that we would encounter such a creature, and such a large one at that, in the Underground Fortress of the Kwantung Army.\n\nPresumably, it had followed the pig-faced Large Bats here. The number of Large Bats within the fortress was beyond counting; we had seen a Stone Cave nest with no fewer than a thousand, and the fortress extended dozens of kilometers deep, possibly hiding several more nests.\n\nThe creature was tough, with a skin so thick and layered with small bone plates underneath that it resembled armor. Once it reached adulthood, this armor was virtually impenetrable.\n\nThe ferocious pig-faced Large Bats, with their sharp claws, could easily tear through the stomachs of cattle and sheep, but they could not harm the Giant Ground Sloth. Even if they scratched at it, it would cause the sloth no pain or irritation. With no natural predators here and countless pig-faced Large Bats to hunt, the Giant Ground Sloth thrived.\n\n However, I had no idea how the colossal Grassland Sloth managed to enter the Fortress. It was possible that an earthquake or a landslide had created large fissures in the Underground Fortress, and it had crawled in through them in search of food. If we could locate that entrance, we might be able to escape through it.\n\nThe Grassland Sloth that had leapt down from the roof devoured the roasted bat meat, its long tongue licked around its mouth a few times. Clearly, such a small piece of meat was not enough to fill its stomach and only whetted its voracious appetite. It eyed the three of us, pondering its next move. In the subterranean world, it was the king, occasionally embarking on hunting expeditions. Whenever it moved, there was scarcely anything that could stop it.\n\nIn the moment of standoff, my mind raced. The layout of the Underground Fortress and the strategies for dealing with wild beasts were somewhat unfamiliar to me. Should I strike first? The submachine gun was within reach, but the firepower of the Type 100 Submachine Gun was quite limited, and the Grassland Sloth's thick hide was more than a match for it. I didn't want to provoke it and end up in a worse situation, with no guarantee of escape.\n\nThe Yousaka-style Rifle, used by the Japanese Army, had excellent penetrating power and should be capable of taking down the Grassland Sloth. However, we only had a few bayonets, and the two rifles we had loaded with bullets were placed some twenty to thirty meters away. Someone would have to distract the Grassland Sloth so I could run and grab a rifle. This back and forth would take a brief but critical span of time, and the Grassland Sloth was dangerously close to our position.\n\nAs these thoughts flashed through my mind, none seemed promising. At that moment, Fatty stood still and whispered to me, \"Old Hu, I remember this creature only eats warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals, not humans. I think we're fine.\" He gently kicked the dead bat towards the Grassland Sloth, signaling that it should take the bat and leave us alone.\n\nUnexpectedly, the Grassland Sloth didn't even glance at the dead bat but instead salivated incessantly at us.\n\nFatty turned to me and asked, \"Why isn't it eating the bat? It keeps staring at us as if it has ill intentions.\"\n\nI dared not get distracted by talking to Fatty. I kept a vigilant watch on every move of the Grassland Sloth, ready to act if it showed any sign of attack. I would have to be quicker, picking up the submachine gun from the ground and unleashing a barrage of bullets at it.\n\nYingzi said, \"We've eaten quite a bit of the roasted bat meat. Perhaps it sees us as bats.\"\n\n Before she had finished speaking, the grassland sloth, unable to resist the tempting scent of the roasted bat meat, began to advance towards us step by step. All wild animals naturally feed on raw flesh, having never tasted cooked meat. Once they experience its flavor, the taste of cooked meat becomes their greatest temptation.\n\nNoting its sluggish pace, I decided that running was wiser than engaging in combat. I called out to the other two, and we turned to flee. But after just a couple of strides, I tripped over a hard object and nearly shattered my knee, tumbling to the ground. Fatty and Yingzi fell alongside me.\n\nPuzzled by what had tripped me, I glanced at the ground, which was smooth and devoid of any object that could have caused a fall. A thought struck me: in our rush to escape, we had forgotten to bring the corpses of the young boy and girl. Could it be the ghosts that tripped us?\n\nThe grassland sloth had probably never seen a two-legged creature like humans before. Smelling the roasted bat on us, it mistook us for bats, albeit unable to accept such oddly shaped ones and wary of the firelight. It hesitated, calculating how to devour the delicious meal now within reach. Seeing us fall, it pounced forward.\n\nIts hind limbs were thick and strong, and with one leap, it was upon Fatty, who seemed the meatiest, and thus its chosen first bite.\n\nFatty, seeing the danger, struggled desperately, his hands scrambling on the ground for a weapon. By chance, he found the skewer used for roasting bats, grabbed it, and plunged it deep into the sloth's arm, blade sinking in up to the hilt.\n\nThe blade, having been heated for a long time, was like a glowing red metal rod. When it pierced the sloth, only the foul stench of charred flesh filled the air. The sloth, an unrivaled force in the caverns below, had never suffered such pain and was both hurt and enraged. Yet, it dared not bite Fatty again and slowly backed away, waiting for another opportunity.\n\nAfter the searing stab, the temperature of the skewer quickly dropped. The fresh blood of the sloth caused wisps of white steam to rise from the blade. Fatty's successful strike was solely due to the skewer's heat; otherwise, it wouldn't have penetrated the beast.\n\nTaking advantage of the moment Fatty repelled the sloth, Yingzi and I each hoisted the military greatcoat containing the children's bodies onto our backs, hoping the little ghosts would cease their mischief.\n\nWith the sacrificial children's corpses on my back, I bent down to pick up the submachine gun, well aware that the Type 100's firepower was insufficient to kill the grassland sloth. But in a critical moment, I hoped to use it for defense.\n\n Before I could even pull back the gun bolt, a claw suddenly reached out from the wall behind me, swiping straight for my head with such speed and force that I had no time to duck. My only option was to use the submachine gun in my hand as a shield. But the claw struck with such power that the weapon was knocked from my grasp and went flying into the darkness beyond the reach of the firelight.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, four grassland sloths had descended from the wall\u2014two large and two small, with the smallest being almost the size of the others. Clearly, they too were lured by the irresistible scent of roasted bat meat and had come to hunt.\n\nWe were completely encircled by the five grassland sloths. If one decided to pounce, the others would surely follow in a frenzied rush to tear us to pieces and devour us.\n\nOur only refuge was the fire. The three of us stood back to back, huddled together: Fatty armed with a bayonet, Yingzi with a submachine gun, and I was left empty-handed.\n\nThe fire, kindled from wood chips, was dimming by the moment and would soon extinguish. If that happened, we would be nothing but a feast for the grassland sloths. The thought alone made me curse our luck inwardly: one was troublesome enough, and now, the entire clan of grassland sloths that occupied this fortress had mobilized. Trapped in a dire situation, I wondered how we could possibly fight our way out.\n\nWe couldn't afford to delay any longer. I grabbed a burning stick from the fire and swung it at the smallest of the grassland sloths blocking our path. Startled by the flames, it recoiled to one side, creating a gap in the encirclement.\n\nThe flame on the stick was already weak, and it nearly went out as I swung it. We didn't dare waste a moment and charged through the opening. The salivating grassland sloths hesitated but then lunged at us in unison.\n\nYingzi's submachine gun spat out a burst of bullets. The leading grassland sloth was hit, and blood spattered from its body. However, their thick, calloused skin meant the bullets penetrated their flesh but could not pierce the bony armor beneath. Instead of being deterred, the creatures became enraged and pressed on, determined to consume us.\n\nWith only Yingzi armed with a submachine gun, Fatty and I waved our burning sticks to fend off the grassland sloths whenever she had to reload. We fought and retreated, and because our escape was somewhat aimless, we inadvertently moved further away from our weapons cache and ended up near the large iron doors of the Gena Warehouse.\n\n Beyond the iron gate lay the Corpse Demon; our initial plan was to eat and drink our fill before meticulously devising a strategy to escape through the passageway beyond the gate. However, an unexpected assault by the slothful behemoths of the Grassland caught us off guard, forcing us to retreat hastily to this spot. The flames on the sticks dwindled, leaving only charred wood with a few sparks above, and our bullets were running low.\n\nThe Grassland giants loomed large, several huddled together forming an insurmountable wall. A mere swipe of their paws would result in broken bones and torn tendons at the least. As the circle of Grassland sloths tightened around us, we found ourselves trapped against the iron gate with no room to maneuver.\n\nThe time had come to risk it all. Fatty and I hurled our smoldering sticks at the Grassland beasts, while Yingzi unleashed a barrage from her Type 100 Submachine Gun, pushing the creatures back a few steps with our final burst of strength. Fatty spun around and pushed open the previously sealed iron gate; I took out the Black Donkey Hoof and hurled it outside.\n\nTo our surprise, the Corpse Demon was not waiting at the door. With no time to ponder, we continued our retreat into the passageway behind the gate. Just as Fatty was about to close the heavy iron door, an immense force slammed against it. The brute strength of the Grassland behemoths, weighing several tons, was truly formidable. The three of us exerted all our might to shut the gate but to no avail.\n\nSuddenly, a bone-chilling wind hit us. I dodged hastily, realizing that the Ancient Corpse, possessed by the death god and a general from the Jin dynasty, had never left the gate's vicinity and was lurking nearby. Bereft of intelligence, the Corpse Demon, like a zombie, was cursed by a sorcerer's talisman to blindly attack the living.\n\nThe Corpse Demon appeared as swiftly and silently as a gust of wind or a flash of lightning. Had I not been battle-hardened with extensive combat experience, it would have already taken me down. I rolled to the ground, scrambling to dodge, when the iron gate was forced open, and the largest of the Grassland sloths leaped out first.\n\nThe Grassland behemoth, using its sturdy hind limbs like a giant frog, sprung from the gate and inadvertently knocked over the Corpse Demon. Unable to bend its body, the Corpse Demon quickly sprang back up, its ten knife-like fingers piercing the chest of the Grassland sloth.\n\nThe Grassland beast let out an odd cry and bit fiercely. The other Grassland sloths, varying in size, swarmed out from the Gena Warehouse. Seeing their kin wounded, they converged to tear and bite at the Corpse Demon.\n\n The smallest of the grassland behemoths was gruesomely decapitated by a Corpse Demon, which in turn was fiercely bitten by two of the creatures. The monstrous strength of both parties was evenly matched, and for a moment, they became entangled. In an instant, the walls, the floor, and the iron doors were splattered with copious amounts of the behemoths' fresh blood, flesh flying everywhere, while the Corpse Demon's arm was bitten off.\n\nThe sight before us was so harrowing that it sent shivers down our spines. Had the Corpse Demon and the grassland behemoths coordinated their attack, the three of us would have undoubtedly met a grim fate with no place to lay our bodies to rest. Our blundering intervention had inadvertently led to a situation where the two beasts fought each other, a stroke of luck indeed.\n\nTime was of the essence. Carrying the corpses of the boy and girl, we fled towards the breach in the tomb wall of the rear chamber. We cursed our lot for not having more legs, scurrying like a family in mourning, floundering like fish slipping through the net. Our disheveled escape needs no detailed description.\n\nThe large hole in the tomb wall had collapsed just as it had been when we first escaped. Now, having returned in full circle without any valuable loot, we had only managed to invite trouble and ended up with two corpses filled with mercury\u2014truly an absurd and laughable outcome. However, despite the underground fortress yielding no treasures, it contained many garments and pieces of equipment, and perhaps a few simple engines could still be found. This information could be shared with the villagers, ensuring our harrowing ordeal in the fortress was not in vain.\n\nAll we needed to do was climb out of the vertical shaft of the thieves' tunnel. By this point, everyone's physical and mental stamina had reached their limits. Yet in desperation, people can summon extraordinary strength, much like a cornered dog fighting to escape. Yingzi unleashed a barrage of submachine gun fire on the lid of the thieves' tunnel's coffin, sending two magazines' worth of bullets flying and shredding the wood to splinters. The coffin lid, originally embedded in the wall, was now riddled with holes. Fatty charged and shouldered it into two pieces, revealing the tunnel once more. I pushed Yingzi up the shaft, then Fatty and I hoisted the corpses of the boy and girl, which Yingzi caught from above before pulling me up.\n\nFatty was left below, as he needed us to pull from above to make it up the shaft. Just as he was about to climb, two blood-soaked grassland behemoths charged into the tomb chamber. They were in a state of frenzied rage, their roars thunderous. It was likely that the rest of their family had been slaughtered by the Corpse Demon. Despite the demon's ferocity, it probably could not withstand the onslaught of such colossal beasts and was torn to shreds.\n\n The two battered grassland sloths, with bloodshot eyes, relentlessly pursued us and followed us right into the tomb chamber. Fatty glanced back, his face paled, and he scrambled towards the vertical shaft, but in his panic, he struggled to make any progress. The grassland sloths had reached the robbers' tunnel, but luckily for us, the tunnel was too narrow for them to squeeze through. They clawed at the earth, desperately trying to widen the tunnel to escape. Seeing the urgency of the situation, I picked up Yingzi's submachine gun and tossed it to Fatty. Understanding the plan, he fired off a few shots to push back the sloths crowding the tunnel entrance, then sprayed bullets at the Tianbao Dragon Fire Glazed Tile Roof above the tomb chamber. The glazed tiles shattered, and bags of Western Region Fire Dragon Oil poured down, engulfing the entire tomb, including the two grassland sloths, in the fierce flames ignited by the oil.\n\nMeanwhile, Yingzi and I mustered our last bit of strength to pull Fatty out of the shaft. Even so, a large portion of Fatty's pants had caught fire from the flames spurting out of the tunnel, and he frantically patted down the flames, screaming in agony like a slaughtered pig. Yingzi hurriedly doused the fire with her water bottle, but his pants were already burned to the point of exposing his backside.\n\nThe loyal hunting dogs sat by our side, watching as their three masters emerged from the hole. It was now midday, and the sunlight was dazzlingly bright, a stark contrast to the gloomy underground fortress\u2014it felt like another world.\n\nFatty, with one hand covering his injury and the other holding up two jade pieces he had acquired from the tomb, examined them in the light. He couldn't help but wax poetic and recited a few famous lines from an epic war poem:\n\n\"The flames of war have been extinguished, the gun smoke has dissipated.\n\nOh sun, you have never been as warm as you are now;\n\nOh sky, you have never been as blue;\n\nThe smiles on the children's faces have never been as sweet.\"\n\nYingzi and I couldn't help but burst into laughter at Fatty's antics\u2014have you ever seen a poet reciting verse while clutching his behind? However, an unexpected event soon froze our smiles."

                    "name": "Chapter 20",
                    "content": "In the forest at the end of the valley, a series of muffled thunderous roars echoed, booming and rolling despite the clear midday sky, free of any dark clouds. Everyone's hearts sank at the sudden thunder\u2014having just emerged from an ancient tomb, they now faced another mystery.\n\nListening more carefully, the sound seemed less like thunder and more like some enormous beast charging towards the valley from afar. Its heavy footsteps, coupled with the relentless crashing against the trees as it ran, at first gave the impression of continuous thunder, punctuated by the occasional bark of a dog.\n\n\"I hear barking,\" I realized, noting that three of our dogs were missing from the valley, leaving only five large hunting dogs lying on the ground. The three giant mastiffs were nowhere to be seen. Exhausted and preoccupied earlier, I hadn't paid much attention to the hunting dogs. Perhaps, with our prolonged absence, they had taken turns hunting for food. What kind of wild animal could cause such a commotion when chased by the giant mastiffs?\n\nYingzi listened intently for a moment, then smiled and said it was nothing to worry about\u2014they were just chasing a wild boar. \"Let's head up the hillside and enjoy the spectacle. We'll have wild boar meat to feast on shortly.\"\n\nAs we climbed halfway up the hill, we could already see the large trees in the forest being knocked down one after another. The valley's hunting dogs could no longer stay put; they scattered in a fan formation, intending to block the wild boar's escape route through the valley.\n\nSuddenly, a red pine snapped at the mouth of the valley, and a giant wild boar burst forth from behind the tree. Had it not been for the creature's lack of a long snout, I might have mistaken it for a young elephant. It weighed easily over a thousand pounds, with black and long bristles, and tusks on either side of its mouth curved upward like two daggers. These tusks were not only a proud symbol of its masculinity but also a sign that it was the king of wild boars in the forest. With its plump and round body, short and thick limbs, it charged into the valley like a whirlwind.\n\nBehind the giant wild boar, the three giant mastiffs pursued at a steady pace, neither lunging nor biting fiercely, nor straying too far. In a line, they all ran into Wildman Gully.\n\nThe boar's skin was as tough as a rhino's, and it would rub its corpulent body against the pine trees in the forest when idle. This served both to scratch an itch and to coat itself with pine resin, warding off the bites of insects. In the summer, the mosquitoes in the deep mountain old forests were as large as small birds. There's a saying in the mountains: \"Three mosquitoes make a dish.\" This wasn't an exaggeration. Even old oxen couldn't withstand the bites of these mountain mosquitoes, but the wild boar was unfazed. Its skin was like a suit of iron armor, impervious to bites. The tusks, along with its massive weight, were the boar's treasures for roaming the forest, offering both offense and defense. Even tigers, human bears, and leopards in the mountains dared not tackle it.\n\nHowever, the giant mastiffs raised by hunters had special techniques for dealing with wild boars. The Tibetan mastiffs were the size of small calves, yet they seemed small compared to the giant wild boar. These three giant mastiffs intended to drive the wild boar deeper into the valley before finishing it off. In the forest, filled with large trees, there was no room to maneuver, and a charging wild boar was akin to a tank.\n\n Deep within Wildman Gully, the layer of fallen leaves was exceedingly thick. The Giant Wild Boar had not even covered half the distance before its substantial weight caused its limbs to sink into the leafy bed. Three large Tibetan Mastiffs encircled it, biting here and there, sapping the wild boar's strength and fighting spirit. Meanwhile, five Large Hunting Dogs formed an outer ring. In such a scenario, they dared not compete with the Tibetan Mastiffs for glory, content instead to play the role of a small cheer squad on the sidelines, shouting encouragement.\n\nFrustrated and desperate, the Giant Wild Boar clumsily struggled within the leaf pile, mustering all its might to leap upwards, miraculously freeing its limbs and shooting up.\n\nThe Giant Mastiffs awaited precisely this moment. As the wild boar reached the apex of its jump, the largest of the three Tibetan Mastiffs also leaped powerfully, like a cannonball fired from its chamber, colliding with the Giant Wild Boar. The force and angle of the impact were perfectly calculated, flipping the boar over, belly-up, onto the deep, soft bed of twigs and decaying leaves.\n\nThe other two Tibetan Mastiffs, lying in wait, wasted no time, pouncing on the Giant Wild Boar's exposed belly to deliver vicious bites. The stomach was the wild boar's only weak spot, and once exposed to the enemy, its fate was sealed, especially against the lion-like ferocity and swiftness of the Tibetan Mastiffs. In less than four seconds, the boar's intestines, stomach, and heart were all torn out.\n\nSeeing that the wild boar was finished, the three of us slowly descended the hillside. Fatty and I, witnessing the incredible coordination of the three Giant Mastiffs and their tactical use of the terrain, couldn't help but want to pat the heads of the Tibetan Mastiffs in commendation, grinning and beckoning them over.\n\nUnexpectedly, the Tibetan Mastiffs and hunting dogs bypassed us, gathering around Yingzi instead. She took out some jerky, feeding it to them. The dogs, seeing their master pleased, wagged their tails in appeasement.\n\nFeeling snubbed, Fatty and I exchanged a look. I shook my head and sighed, \"Damn it, our warm faces have met with the dogs' cold backsides.\"\n\nFatty huffed and said, \"Old Hu, do you remember what Mr. Lu Xun once said about sycophantic dogs? That's just the nature of these creatures. They look down on people with disdain, fail to recognize faces, and only know to fawn over power. Let's not stoop to their level.\"\n\n Fatty returned to the tent to fetch a knife, a pickaxe head, and a hunting shotgun, then came back to the valley to assist Yingzi in butchering the wild boar. Carrying the shotgun and accompanied by two large dogs, I went down the hillside to find a spot to bury the young boy and girl, to prevent them from troubling us again.\n\nYingzi asked, \"Brother Hu, are you hungry? Why don't we eat something before we go?\"\n\nI replied, \"No need. A good meal can wait. I'll just be hungrier later. We shouldn't wait until night to bury the dead; that would be rather unsettling.\"\n\nI had the two large dogs drag the bodies of the children, wrapped in a military greatcoat, to a spot facing the vast grassland, where I dug a deep pit. My engineer soldier's shovel had been left behind in the ancient tomb, so digging with the pickaxe head was exhausting. The sun was setting, and after digging just over a meter deep, I was drenched in sweat and my stomach was rumbling.\n\nLooking at the pit, over a meter deep, I thought to myself that it was sufficient. After all, they were just children; burying them too deep was unnecessary. Their bodies were filled with mercury, so there was no concern about insects or rodents.\n\nSo, I took the children out of the military greatcoat, rewrapped them neatly in two more coats, and laid them side by side in the pit. I clasped my hands in prayer and bowed twice: \"Young friends from ancient times, it's regrettable that you didn't live in a new society filled with civilization, democracy, and sunshine, where you could have experienced societal care. But this was all destined, and there's no need to cling to it. Life has its end, and one should not forget. Many things are beyond our control; they are determined by fate. After death, burial brings peace. Those not at peace become zombies. Our resources are limited here; we have no coffin to lay you in, nor incense to honor you with. After I return, I will burn more paper money for you, in the hope that you will reach the Western Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss soon. Do not entangle us any longer; we too are busy with our work. This is all we can do for you. Being greedy and insatiable is not the trait of a good child.\"\n\nAfter saying this, I pushed the soil back into the pit with the help of the two large dogs, and with a few handfuls of earth, I buried the two ill-fated boy and girl servants. Looking back towards the distance, I saw the setting sun, blood-red, and was filled with a myriad of emotions.\n\nIt was getting late. Yingzi called out to me from afar to return. So, with the hunting dogs, I made my way back to our campsite on the hillside. Fatty had moved a large stone to firmly block the ventilation hole that a large bat had used to attack the horses. The aroma of pine resin mixed with the scent of roasting wild boar meat, as well as a pot of soup made with pig offal and ground mushrooms and wood ear fungus, assaulted my senses. I couldn't wait to rush over, cut off a piece of meat with a knife, and stuff it into my mouth.\n\n After dinner, we sipped the tea bricks brewed by Yingzi, discussing our return journey. Without the horses to carry our luggage, the trek back to Ganggang Camp was daunting. We couldn't move our pots, pans, and tents, and the animal skins we'd hunted along the way would have to be left behind\u2014a significant loss. Eventually, Yingzi had an idea: send two dogs back with a message, asking the villagers to organize a horse team to excavate the Kwantung Army's fortress. There were too many valuables here to leave behind; it would be a waste. Moreover, the dogs would make excellent guides for the villagers. In the meantime, we would find a safe place nearby to stay until everyone arrived, then move the goods together.\n\nAt this point, we had no other choice. Fatty, seemingly unconcerned with our predicament, took out the two jade bi he had been obsessing over. I scolded him, \"You're hopeless, unable to wait even for dawn in your poverty. Stop carrying those jade pieces around; looking at them over a hundred times a day, aren't you afraid they'll wear out? Better let me keep them safe.\"\n\nFatty held the jade bi up to my face, his expression full of astonishment, \"Old Hu, are these the ones we took from the ancient tomb? Take a look, is there something off about them?\"\n\nSince obtaining the pair of jade bi from the tomb, I hadn't had the chance to examine them closely. Fatty, with his exaggerated surprise, handed them to me, \"Why has the color changed again?\" I took the jade bi and scrutinized them.\n\nBoth jade pieces were carved into shapes resembling moths, with every detail vividly present, as if they were alive. The body of the bi-disc was adorned with patterns of strange creatures, likely fantastical rather than real. They were plump, their bodies somewhat resembling lean lions, or perhaps scaleless flood dragons, with several claws and a curled, large tail. The patterns were bizarre and might not represent animals at all, but rather clouds or waves.\n\nThe craftsmanship of the patterns on the bi-disc's body was not as refined as the sculpting of the form, merely outlined with a few strokes. Despite the roughness, there was a sense of simplicity and expressiveness to it. Sometimes, simplicity is its own form of beauty.\n\nIt was truly puzzling. I remembered when we first retrieved them from the ancient tomb's coffin, the jade bi were a deep green. Yet, when observed inside the Kwantung Army fortress, their color appeared a pale yellow.\n\n At this moment, the hue was a deep, deep yellow, its color having changed several times within the day, a mystery to us all. Could it be that there exists such a thing as Color-Changing Jade in this world? Our ignorance of antiques was apparent, and it seemed we had no choice but to return to Beijing to seek the expertise of Big Gold Tooth, a dealer in antiques, to enlighten us.\n\nReflecting on this grave-robbing expedition, it was far from smooth sailing. The hardships endured along the way were just the beginning. The ancient tomb we discovered in Wildman Gully, belonging to a general, was disappointingly sparse in burial artifacts. The only item of potential value was this pair of Jade Bi, and even obtaining them was a near-fatal ordeal. The difficulty of the task was such that no metaphor, not even \"carrying mountains and seas,\" could adequately convey it, and the peril was such that \"skating on thin ice by an abyss\" seemed an understatement. If these were to be appraised as worthless, I might as well find a wall to dash my head against.\n\nThis experience has taught me a lesson: not all noble tombs contain a trove of valuable funeral objects. One must thoroughly understand the historical and cultural background of the tombs, and possess a broad knowledge of antique appreciation. Only with this information can one target the right tombs and ensure that the efforts are not in vain.\n\nFatty, on the other hand, was brimming with confidence, betting that the Jade Bi could fetch at least thirty to fifty thousand yuan, or perhaps even be recognized as national treasures. In that case, we wouldn't sell them to businesspeople from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Instead, we'd offer them directly to The Palace Museum. Should the government be pleased, a reward of a hundred thousand or eighty thousand would be like child's play. They might even allocate us an apartment in Beijing and have us wear a Big Red Flower, touring the country to give report speeches. We could stir emotions with our stories, and upon finishing, the female university students in the audience, with tears brimming in their eyes, would rush to present us with flowers and love letters.\n\nI told him to stop dreaming, that it would be a stroke of luck if we weren't sent to squat in a clay kiln instead of being invited to a Model Workers' Deeds Report Meeting. Nevertheless, if we could indeed net thirty to fifty thousand yuan as Fatty claimed, it would be an unexpected windfall. After all, our year-round hustle selling cassette tapes barely scraped together three to four thousand yuan. In bad years, after deducting expenses for food and accommodation, we hardly made any profit.\n\nHaving not slept for two days, I chatted briefly with Fatty and Yingzi after a full meal and promptly fell asleep. With the hunting dogs standing guard, there was no need to fear wild beast attacks. I slept through the confusion of the world, and in my dreams, I returned to the battlefield shrouded in gun smoke. The sky above the trenches was filled with the faces of my brothers-in-arms, each one youthful. They had faces but no bodies, and these faces were bleeding incessantly, slowly ascending to the heavens. I lay on the ground, crying and shouting, wanting to grasp them, but despite my frantic efforts, I was paralyzed, unable to move an inch.\n\n The evening passed without incident; the large bats that dwelled underground had vanished without a trace, likely having been frightened off by the gunfire to seek a new cavern to call home.\n\nI slept through to noon before waking. By that time, Yingzi had already dispatched three hunting dogs to deliver messages back home, each dog's neck adorned with a small leather pouch containing a note penned by Fatty. It instructed those in the village to bring additional manpower and tools, and if possible, explosives, to Wildman Gully for the excavation of the Kwantung Army's Western Relics.\n\nAfter a meal of wild boar at midday, we moved our tents and supplies near the entrance of the valley, setting up camp behind a large boulder that shielded us from the wind. This spot, at the edge of the forest and grassland, would be easily found by the villagers when they arrived.\n\nYingzi went to forage for wild greens with the dogs while I dug a pit for a stove and set a pot to boil water. We had brought some flour, so Fatty set to work making dumplings stuffed with prime mushroom and wild boar meat, a feast to celebrate our initial success. Though we'd had a close call, we were unscathed and had made some gains, particularly the wealth of supplies in the Kwantung Army Fortress, which would greatly aid the villagers' lives. This achievement alone was worth a toast or two.\n\nThus, we spent our days hunting with the dogs, and over ten days had passed. I felt almost like a hunter of the mountains. At last, the villagers arrived\u2014over forty in number, led by the Branch Secretary and the accountant. With the men away working at Ox Heart Mountain, it was mostly women, girls, and older children who came. The village had few horses, no more than ten, and hearing of the abundance of Western Relics, they feared not having enough mounts, so they brought along mules and donkeys as well. Along with their own hunting dogs, they made a noisy entrance through Black Wind Pass.\n\nEveryone was eager to start, but I suggested that after their arduous journey, we should rest for a day to regain our strength before beginning work. Moreover, we couldn't proceed haphazardly. Having served as a combat engineer, I volunteered to take charge, planning to distribute tasks and utilize operational research to devise a plan. I urged that we act methodically and not like a disorderly mob.\n\n The crowd buzzed with a noisy excitement, finding amusement in the situation as they whispered and speculated among themselves, drowning out my voice. No one could hear me clearly until the Branch Secretary had to intervene, bellowing for silence: \"Quiet down, everyone! Listen to my nephew here. What he says is what I say, and that's the word from the organization. We owe it to my two nephews and Yingzi, this young lady, for the chance to recover these Western Relics from the little Ghost. Whatever they say, that's how we'll proceed.\"\n\nI repeated my instructions, telling everyone to set up tents, get the pots ready for cooking, eat, and rest. Then, in consultation with the secretary and the accountant, we discussed our lack of explosives. Nevertheless, accessing the Underground Fortress wasn't too daunting a task. We could start from the General's Tomb, which was close to the Fortress's passageway. With five people working, we could clear the collapsed Tomb Chamber in less than half a day. However, we had to be prepared for wild beasts that might be lurking within the Fortress. Creatures that dwell underground are afraid of fire, so we'd need plenty of torches. It was crucial to emphasize that once inside, no one should act on their own. We were not to take any of the munitions, only the supplies needed for daily life\u2014Military Greatcoats, Japanese boots, blankets, motors, cables, and wires. We would take as much as we could carry, then reseal the Fortress without letting the information leak. Otherwise, we'd have to surrender our finds.\n\nThe Branch Secretary pounded his chest in assurance: \"Nephew, rest easy. Once these folks have their share, they'll keep tight-lipped. They've learned their lesson from the earthquake year when many went to Ox Heart Mountain seeking Treasure, only to have it confiscated by the Cultural Relics Bureau. This time they're wiser. Even with a gun to their head, no one would spill the beans. Besides, our Village is so secluded, we hardly see an outsider all year round. This time, we'll make a fortune in silence.\"\n\nThat evening we buried pots to cook, set up camp, and rested. The next morning, I divided the forty-some men and women, young and old, into four groups. The first group, the youngest, was led by Yingzi to hunt in the mountains. Another, composed of the eldest, stayed behind at camp to cook for everyone, led by the accountant. Fatty and I each took a group of strong young people to take turns excavating the collapsed General's Tomb, under the overall command of the Branch Secretary.\n\nThe villagers had brought a plethora of tools\u2014spades, pickaxes, shovels, and even a few utterly unnecessary hoes. I split my group of ten into two teams: one to dig out the collapsed earth and Glazed Tiles, and the other to transport the excavated soil and rocks. The project progressed in an orderly fashion.\n\n Suddenly, from nowhere, a dark cloud drifted over, and with a flash of lightning, a sudden hailstorm descended upon us. Everyone was thrown into disarray, scrambling for the shelter of tents near the mouth of the valley to escape the pelting ice.\n\nUpon returning to the camp, the accountant took a headcount and found that, in addition to the hunting party that had ventured into the mountains, we were short by three people.\n\nThe weather in the wilderness is fickle, changing at a moment's notice. This hailstorm had come on too quickly; there had been past incidents of hail causing fatalities among both humans and animals. So, when the hail began, everyone used whatever they could find to shield their heads and ran back in a panic, and in the confusion, it was inevitable that some would lose their way.\n\nWhat concerned me most, however, was the legendary opium den. Ever since our arrival at Wildman Gully, we had been exceedingly cautious, yet we had not encountered any opium dens. Over the past few days, our vigilance had somewhat relaxed. If, by some misfortune, we were to stumble upon one and get trapped inside, not even a deity could rescue us.\n\nI said to the Branch Secretary, \"Let's take stock and figure out which three people are missing and which group they belong to. That way, we can estimate where they might be, and I'll take a few people to start a search.\"\n\nThe Branch Secretary replied, \"Ah, my dear nephew, you have such a sharp mind. I get so flustered that everything turns dark before my eyes; my brain just stops working in a crisis. Let's have the accountant check which three are missing.\"\n\nAs the crowd calmed down from the chaos of the hailstorm, the hail itself also ceased. The storm had been brief but intense, and as quickly as it had arrived, it departed, driven away by gusting winds that scattered the dark clouds. The mountain wind howled, whipping up the fallen leaves within Wildman Gully into a frenzy, and the weather turned chilly in an instant.\n\nThe accountant went from tent to tent tallying up the numbers, and eventually came to report to the Branch Secretary and me, \"Uncle, the three missing are Bai Ling, Gui Lan, those two girls, and Old Wang's second daughter-in-law. What are we going to do? We should hurry and use dogs to help us search.\"\n\nThese three belonged to Fatty's group. Since it wasn't their turn to work yet, they had been idly chatting in small clusters along the east and west sides of the gully. When the weather turned, everyone was preoccupied with getting back, and no one noticed their absence.\n\nThe Branch Secretary said, \"These three, I told them not to come, but they insisted. And now they've caused a commotion. Hu Da, my nephew, what do you think? Should we all go look for them?\"\n\nI replied, \"The hail and rain came down so fiercely just now; they might have run off to find shelter from the rain. We shouldn't send too many people; more isn't always better. Otherwise, we might end up losing a few more in the search, and that would only compound our troubles. I'll take four or five people who are nimble and used to walking the mountain paths. I've lived in Wildman Gully for half a month and know the terrain well. You don't need to worry; just stay at the camp. It's gotten cooler, so have the women brew some ginger tea to ward off the chill.\"\n\nThe Branch Secretary slapped his thigh in agreement: \"That's exactly what we should do.\"\n\n Fatty and I, accompanied by five hunters accustomed to traversing streams and scaling mountains, began our search from the ancient tomb at the heart of Wildman Gully. Most of the hunting dogs had been taken by Yingzi and her group into the mountains for hunting, as we needed a substantial amount of food and meat to feed nearly fifty people. The hunting party was short on dogs.\n\nWe also needed to leave a few dogs behind to guard the camp against wild beasts. Thus, we only brought three with us, of which only one was a hunting dog; the other two were large, domestic watchdogs.\n\nWildman Gully ran north to south, with the vast grasslands of Outer Mongolia to the north, where our camp was located. To the south lay a chain of undulating mountains and primal forests. At that moment, a strong wind was blowing, whistling through Wildman Gully. We moved with the wind, which made the dogs' sense of smell less effective.\n\nLeading the search party, we called out as we went, making our way to the southern exit of Wildman Gully. There, the trees grew dense, a thicket of white birch and larch. Apart from our shouts, the sound of our footsteps, and the barking of the dogs, only the whooshing of the wind could be heard. I felt an unusual stillness here; it was too quiet, almost eerily so. It seemed as if no animals or birds inhabited this patch of forest, not even the common little squirrels, which added to the oppressive atmosphere.\n\nThree giant mastiffs had once driven a giant wild boar out of this forest. Due to its quietness, we had never hunted in this area before. I was hesitating when suddenly the hunting dog barked.\n\nI released the hunting dog, and it darted out like an arrow, with all of us following closely behind. Underneath a large pine tree, we found three missing women. The girls, Bai Ling and Gui Lan, were holding onto the second daughter-in-law of the Wang family, at a loss of what to do. They called out to us urgently to help save her. They had heard our shouts for a while but, against the wind, we hadn't heard theirs.\n\nThe second daughter-in-law of the Wang family was frothing at the mouth and unconscious. I checked her breathing with my finger: she was fine, breathing steadily, not poisoned, likely just fainted from fright. A rest back at the camp should bring her around. \"How did you end up here?\" I asked. \"Did you encounter a wild beast?\"\n\nBai Ling recounted their ordeal. While waiting to start work, they were chatting idly in Wildman Gully. Women's conversations usually revolved around which young man was strikingly handsome or which girl was rather plain. They were deeply engaged in their talk when, without warning, the clear sky clouded over, and a fierce hailstorm hit, giving them no time to even glance at the sky. The three, none of whom had hunters in their families and were all accustomed to farming, lacked the experience of deep forest navigation. In a panic to find shelter, they lost their bearings and ended up running southward.\n\nGui Lan added that the second daughter-in-law of the Wang family was a few years older than the two of them, and they respectfully called her 'Second Sister-in-law.' They had a good relationship with her back in the village. Initially, they just followed Second Sister-in-law, too busy shielding their heads and not paying attention to their surroundings. But as they ran, they realized something was amiss. Once the hail stopped, they took a closer look and found themselves surrounded by trees. Apart from the three of them, not a soul was in sight. The dense canopy of trees blocked out the sky like a giant umbrella, and the mountain wind blew the fallen leaves around like snowflakes, a truly frightening sight. Gui Lan asked Second Sister-in-law if they had run in the wrong direction and suggested they should head back immediately.\n\n My sister-in-law found it odd when the sky suddenly darkened, and she saw a swarm of people tumbling toward this direction, nearly all of them men. Their faces were unclear, and she was so dazed by the hail that she didn't give it much thought and just followed the crowd. In the end, aside from her two younger sisters, everyone had vanished, leaving them alone and frightened.\n\nSuddenly, they spotted a group of people huddled under an ancient tree, several hundred in number, all men, squatting in rows so that only their backs were visible. The sisters had heard tales of mountain-dwellers gathering ginseng and Ganoderma, precious medicinal herbs, especially the ginseng, known by many names such as 'divine herb' or 'earth spirit's cudgel.' Such treasures grew deep in the mountains, and a centuries-old ginseng could even become sentient, able to transform into a chubby boy or a young maiden. If a forager stumbled upon a rare old mountain ginseng, they mustn't exclaim their discovery but instead use code like 'two-horned lantern' or 'triple-petaled palm' to avoid alerting the ginseng spirit, which would vanish into the earth. One had to quietly tie a red string around it and wait until nightfall when the ginseng slept to dig it up. Before the digging, they would worship the mountain deity, fast, bathe, and wrap the unearthed ginseng in red cloth to bring it home safely.\n\nThe men squatting motionless sparked their curiosity: were they harvesting ginseng? And why were there so many of them? Driven by curiosity, she decided to take a closer look, despite the protests from the timid Bai Ling and Gui Lan. Ignoring them, she approached and tapped one of the squatting men on the shoulder, asking, \"Brother, what are you up to?\"\n\nWhatever she saw next, her scream of horror was the last thing she uttered before fainting. Bai Ling and the other sister rushed to her aid, only to find that the men under the tree had disappeared without a trace, as if they had evaporated into the forest air.\n\nBai Ling told me, \"Brother Hu, then you guys came along. It scared us to death. It's broad daylight, and we saw ghosts. All those old folks were crouching there, and in the blink of an eye, they were gone.\"\n\nI called Fatty over to investigate the spot Bai Ling mentioned. Leaves littered the ground; autumn was half over, and deep fall was approaching. The leaves of the white birch trees rustled in the wind, but there was no sign of the hundreds of men. As we searched, we knew we had to quickly uncover any potential threats to our group.\n\nNot far along, Fatty tripped and fell flat on his face. Cursing, he got up, thinking he had stumbled over a tree root, but a touch revealed it felt unlike one. Bringing it closer for inspection, he instantly dropped it in shock, exclaiming, \"My God, a human thigh!\"\n\nI found his reaction odd and went over to pick it up. It was, in fact, a human forearm bone. Back where Fatty had fallen, more bone protruded from the earth, likely broken off when Fatty's leg had struck it.\n\nI sent two men to escort Bai Ling and her sisters back, then led the remaining few to dig up the soil with the butt of our hunting rifles. We didn't have to dig far before uncovering a mass of human bones. Fatty asked me, \"My heavens, could these be the laborers who built the Kwantung Army's Underground Fortress? Did the Kwantung Army kill them and bury them here in this forest's pit of ten thousand corpses? The figures Gui Lan and her sisters saw, could they have been ghosts?\"\n\n A bone-chilling mountain breeze swept through, the cold intensifying, causing the few people digging in the earth to break out in goosebumps all over their bodies.\n\nMoth-bodied Chi-patterned Double Dagger-shaped Bi\n\nSkeleton after skeleton was buried and compressed within the soil. We had only uncovered a small patch beneath the layer of fallen leaves, yet it was already impossible to count the number of human bones. The bones bore clear signs of savage killing, with knife marks visible on the ribs, neck bones, and skulls. Numerous decapitated heads, clearly severed by a blade, were scattered among them.\n\nThere are many legends about Black Wind Pass, but perhaps the most famous is the battle at the end of the Jin dynasty and the beginning of the Yuan dynasty when the Mongols decisively defeated the main Jin forces. Hundreds of thousands of Jin soldiers lay dead, their bodies piled into mountains. When the Mongols cleaned up the battlefield, they carelessly tossed the corpses into Wildman Gully. It is said that they filled the entire valley, and now, nearly a thousand years later, those soldiers and generals have long since decayed into the soil and air.\n\nThe numerous white bones in the forest are unlikely to be remnants from that era. The Black Wind Pass battle between the Jin and Yuan dynasties is the only large-scale battle known to have taken place here in history, until the Kwantung Army's secret deployment. Since then, no other battles have been recorded.\n\nAfter much thought, there seemed to be only one possibility. Comrade Lenin once said: When analyzing any problem, the absolute requirement for a Marxist is to place the issue within a certain historical context. Fatty felt that the multitude of human bones in the forest were likely those of Chinese laborers killed by the Kwantung Army, a hypothesis that fully conformed to Comrade Lenin's criteria.\n\nBut there was one thing that puzzled him. As Fatty walked under a tree, he stumbled over an arm bone, which led to the discovery of the mass grave buried in the earth. However, how could an arm bone be sticking out halfway from the ground?\n\nThis fact was somewhat jarring. If an arm had been exposed when the Kwantung Army buried the bodies, the carcasses would have long been dug up and devoured by wild beasts. Could it be that it deliberately stretched out from the earth to trip Fatty, to make us discover them? The thought gave me the creeps, and I dared not delve deeper into it. I called everyone to refill the excavated earth and hurried back to camp to discuss countermeasures with the Branch Secretary.\n\nWe rushed back to the camp at the other end of the valley, where we found Yingzi and her team had also returned from hunting in the mountains. Despite encountering hail, they had managed to hunt several roe deer, bears, and wild roes, enough to feed the people and hunting dogs for three or four meals.\n\n Several older women were busy cooking, while others rested or gathered inside a tent to visit Old Wang's daughter-in-law. I entered the tent and saw that she had regained consciousness, sipping some hot ginger soup, and was recounting her ordeal in the woods to the Branch Secretary and others: \"So I got closer, and oh my, can you guess what it was? You'd never believe it, but here's what happened\u2014oh, that thing, it was so frightening.\"\n\nThe Branch Secretary, growing impatient, urged her: \"What are you doing, spinning yarns and performing like you're in a pingshu or singing a Beijing opera about heroes of Liangshan? Cut the nonsense and get to the point.\"\n\nOld Wang's feisty daughter-in-law shot the Branch Secretary a glare: \"What's the rush? I'm getting to it. Don't interrupt, okay? Where was I? You're trying to guess what happened? Well, I saw a group of people squatting in a circle, looking shabby, one worse than the other. I was puzzled and wanted to see what was going on. At first, I thought they were regular ginseng diggers, but as I approached, I realized they weren't. They were all bowing to a big tree. Bowing to a tree, as if it were a Bodhisattva or something. So I slapped one of them on the back to ask what they were doing, and guess what happened?\"\n\nThe Branch Secretary, exasperated, said: \"You're impossible, really. How on earth did Old Wang ever marry such a woman? It's so frustrating talking to you. Old Wang should take you home and give you a good talking-to.\"\n\nFearing the conversation was getting out of hand, I shot Yingzi a look, and understanding the cue, she quickly changed the subject and took Old Wang's daughter-in-law by the hand: \"Sister-in-law, so what happened next? What did you see?\"\n\nOld Wang's daughter-in-law told Yingzi: \"Oh, he was squatting there, and when he turned around\u2014my goodness, he had no head! I got so scared I fainted. When I came to, I was here in the tent, with Bling tending to me and feeding me soup. And now, I'm telling you the whole story, how it all happened.\"\n\nThe women around were afraid of ghosts, and they began to murmur among themselves after hearing her story. The Branch Secretary quickly stood up and declared: \"Ghosts and spirits, what nonsense! We are now basking in the spring breeze of Reform and Opening-up, soaking in the sunlight of the household responsibility system. In broad daylight, with the universe so clear, no one should spout such foolishness.\"\n\nI took the Branch Secretary out of the tent to a secluded spot and told him everything I had seen and heard in the woods.\n\nAfter listening, the Branch Secretary shed tears: \"Our village suffered greatly at the hands of the 'little devils' during the war; they took many for forced labor, and none returned. My own uncle was among those taken, rumored to have been sent by the Kwantung Army to mine coal in Hokkaido, Japan. Others said he was taken to the Greater Khingan Range to work on construction projects. To this day, there's no certainty of his fate\u2014neither seen in life nor found in death. My grandmother went blind from crying, still hoping for his return, a hope unfulfilled even to her death. Among those bones buried in the woods, there might be our fellow villagers. Even if not, they are still our Chinese compatriots. In good conscience, we cannot ignore this. Furthermore, if the resentment of these souls is too strong, their unrest could terrify us all. We would no longer be able to search for Western relics. Nephew, don't you think we should exhume them and give them a proper reburial?\"\n\n I offered him a few words of advice. In such a situation, there wasn't much we could do with our abilities. A mass grave left by the Japanese Army had been discovered at Pingdingshan, containing the remains of thousands. To find and properly rebury each set of remains was nearly an impossible task, as many skeletons were already fragmented and scattered. Haphazardly piecing together a skull from one body with the torso of another showed great disrespect to the deceased. Moreover, we couldn't just come all this way to collect the Kwantung Army's Western Relics and leave empty-handed. What I mean is, we should bring offerings of incense, wine, and meat to the forest to pay our respects, and perhaps later erect a monument in their memory.\n\nThe Branch Secretary wiped his tears and runny nose with his sleeve and replied, \"That's right. When we return to the village, we'll organize some of the local lamas to recite scriptures and pray for the souls, to help them rest in peace.\"\n\nI never used to believe in ghosts, until recently when I came to understand a truth: there's nothing in this world that can be said to definitely not exist. A hunter goes into the mountains and comes back empty-handed after a whole day\u2014that doesn't mean there are no wild animals there. What we see and hear in life is but a tiny fraction compared to the vastness of the universe. We should hold a sense of reverence for the unknown. Even if there are no specters causing mischief, the remains of those who died in the forest deserve our sympathy and it is necessary to do something for them from any perspective.\n\nAfter the incident with Old Wang's second daughter-in-law, the people in the village have started to doubt and suspect the presence of ghosts. This place is truly strange; anything can happen. We can't afford to delay any longer at Black Wind Pass; who knows what else might occur.\n\nAfter lunch, I had Fatty continue leading two groups to excavate the Kwantung Army's fortress, aiming to break through a passage by nightfall. The accountant was still to stay at the camp, preparing dinner with a few of the older women, while also watching over the mules and supplies. The Branch Secretary, Yingzi, and I, along with a few of the braver souls, took several jugs of liquor\u2014home-brewed by the villagers\u2014and some dried meat, and went to the southern end of Wildman Gully's forest to pay tribute to the spirits of the deceased laborers.\n\n By this time, the wind had ceased, and the woods were steeped in silence. We laid out our offerings of meat and wine on the ground. In lieu of incense, we stuck a few cigarettes upright in the soil. The Branch Secretary, amidst a flood of snot and tears, made fervent vows and pledges. The minor spirits had long been scared away; he swore to enlist lamas to pray for the souls of the departed and to erect a monument in their memory.\n\nOnly then did I realize that of all the villagers, the Branch Secretary was the most superstitious. Once he started on his beliefs, there seemed to be no end. I stood by, smoking, waiting, when suddenly, I felt something amiss in the woods.\n\nThe trees here were sparse, a far cry from the towering giants of primeval forests. What struck me as most peculiar was the presence of several withered old locust trees. In the forests of the Sino-Mongolian Border, one mostly finds pines and birches; locust trees, let alone the common thorny locusts of the northeast, are virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe locust tree is inherently yin, as can be inferred from its name\u2014a character for 'wood' combined with 'ghost.' If such a tree dies, it becomes even more saturated with yin. According to the Sixteen-Character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Secret Technique, one of the sixteen characters strictly prohibits the presence of dead locust, willow, or poplar trees around a grave. Otherwise, the deceased's soul becomes entangled in the yin energy, pinned within several miles of the dead locust, unable to leave. In ancient times, after slaying their enemies, some would bury the corpses next to withered locust trees, ensuring their foes could not rest even in death.\n\nI quickly surveyed the locust trees in the vicinity\u2014all dead, seven in total, arranged in the pattern of the Big Dipper's sweeping tail. Whether this was a natural formation or the work of a Japanese with knowledge of yin and yang was unclear. No wonder Old Wang's daughter-in-law saw those lost souls crouching under the trees; surely, these spirits sought to escape the woods during the changing of heaven and earth, yet ultimately failed to break free.\n\nI explained the situation to the Branch Secretary, urging that we cut down these dead locust trees at once.\n\nWith the decisive vigor of a moth-bodied, chi-patterned double dagger-shaped bi, the Branch Secretary commanded everyone to get to work. Despite lacking proper tools for felling trees, the dead locusts, already decayed, came down easily without much effort.\n\nIn the time it took to finish a meal, all seven ancient locusts were felled. The Branch Secretary was very pleased. He poured out the remaining wine into the earth, laid out wild fruits and apricots, and offered up deer and rabbit meat. We stood in silent tribute. Yingzi and I, along with a few others, dug firebreaks and lit a fire to burn the locust wood.\n\nFlames soared high, and the dry wood crackled strangely, emitting plumes of black smoke. The stench was unbearable, and people covered their noses, standing back at a distance. Only when sparks flew out of the firebreaks did anyone approach to extinguish them.\n\n Starting a fire in the forest is no child's play; a careless act could spark a wildfire that sweeps across the land. We couldn't afford even a hint of negligence, and so we watched anxiously, guarding the flames until they were completely extinguished. Afterwards, we buried the ashes with soil to prevent any chance of them reigniting.\n\nAfter a bustling day, it wasn't until evening that we finished. Upon returning to Wildman Gully, we found that Fatty and the others had already unearthed the Underground Fortress. Everyone hurried back to camp and were relieved to see that Old Wang's daughter-in-law was no longer in danger. She could eat and walk again, so we all feasted and drank our fill to restore our strength.\n\nAt the break of dawn the next day, we lit torches soaked in pine resin. More than twenty of us, leading several mules, entered the Underground Fortress through a passage extended from the wall of General's Tomb. At the iron doors of the Gena Warehouse, the signs of a struggle were evident. The Ancient Corpse had been torn to shreds, and the bodies of several large Grassland sloths lay nearby, their blood dried to a dark red hue. The sight of these things was still enough to send a shiver down the spine.\n\nThere was no longer any danger here, and with our many torches\u2014especially those fueled by pine resin, which burn long and are not easily extinguished by the wind\u2014even the fiercest of animals lurking in the Underground Fortress would not dare to approach.\n\nThe Branch Secretary was overjoyed at the sight of such a vast amount of Japanese Army supplies, far exceeding his most optimistic estimates. He eagerly called everyone to gather the Western Relics, and we loaded the mules with bundles of military greatcoats, shoes, rainproof cloths, dry batteries, and field mess kits, continuing to transport them out.\n\nIn the remote mountain villages, what we lacked most were these industrial products. Everyone raced to be the first, displaying a spirit of bravery reminiscent of the era of the Great Leap Forward, calling out to each other as they worked.\n\nYingzi and I led a few others in search of another section of the passage. According to the map, there was an even larger warehouse on the other side, which wasn't difficult to find if one followed the map.\n\nThe warehouse doors were tightly shut, and it took a horse to pull them open. Inside, we were all dumbstruck: row upon row of artillery pieces, like mountain guns, field howitzers, Type 60 Cannons, mortars of various sizes, and ammunition boxes piled up like mountains, stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\nIt seemed these guns were prepared for maneuver warfare. The entire Japanese Army could be divided into six parts, including the home army, which was stationed across the Japanese islands and its colonies, including Taiwan and Korea. These troops were known as the home army.\n\n In addition to the Chinese Expeditionary Army, which refers to the forces that invaded mainland China, there was also the Southern Army, which operated in Southeast Asia and Australia, as well as the Navy and Air Force, and the Kwantung Army stationed in Manchukuo. Altogether, these comprised the six major Military Regions.\n\nOf these, the Kwantung Army was most favored by the Emperor and the Imperial General Headquarters, heralded as the elite of the elite. The Japanese held China's northeastern provinces in higher esteem than their own land for three key reasons: first, the strategic depth was considerable; second, the region was rich in resources, with its forests and mineral deposits beyond measure; third, it offered a high ground advantage, poised to strike the heartland at any moment. Long ago, Japan had articulated its covetous gaze upon the Northeast through the infamous Tanaka Memorial, and even during World War II, the so-called Tanaka Plan emerged, which underscored the extent of Japan's fixation on Manchuria, to the point of preferring it over the Japanese homeland itself.\n\nThus, the Kwantung Army's equipment and supplies were second to none among Japan's military forces, rivaled only by the Navy's Combined Fleet. However, these militaristic ambitions have long since become a laughingstock before the wheels of history. We need not extend any courtesy to the Kwantung Army; they certainly didn't afford us any. Rolling up our sleeves, we clamored to take everything back with us.\n\nI cautioned them to be wary of torches near the ammunition boxes, for an explosion would leave no chance of escape\u2014we would all be buried alive. Behind the countless artillery pieces lay even more large wooden crates, stamped with the red steel seal of Kashima Heavy Industries. Upon prying one open, we found it full of small electric motors, but they were too heavy to lift, impossible for the horses to carry. We had no choice but to dismantle them and carry the parts back piecemeal.\n\nThe supplies from the Underground Fortress took an entire day to move, and we had barely scratched the surface. The accountant busied himself tallying the haul, which was a fortune in itself\u2014enough to use and to sell.\n\nAt dinner, the Branch Secretary approached me with a concern. At this rate, the transportation was endless, and the mules couldn't carry so much. With deep autumn upon us, if we left a team to guard the site and another to transport the goods back to the village, the difficult mountain paths would mean each round trip would take over half a month. We wouldn't manage more than two trips before the heavy snow sealed off the mountain. He suggested burying the entrance to the Fortress and having everyone return to the village, to resume the work the following spring.\n\nI agreed, having been away from Beijing for over a month and growing weary of the mountain's confines. We needed to sell the relics we had unearthed to Big Gold Tooth. I acquiesced to the Branch Secretary's proposal, knowing that Fatty and I were unlikely to return with them. I entrusted the Branch Secretary to come back to Black Wind Pass next spring and offer paper money for the entombed boy and girl. Moreover, I emphasized the importance of not tampering with the munitions in the Underground Fortress, as they were not meant for civilian use.\n\n The Branch Secretary, having understood the situation, readily promised to address the matter, saying that upon returning to the village, he would find a lama to chant sutras and, incidentally, take the two children along to be blessed as well.\n\nIn order to depart the next day, nearly everyone stayed up all night, busily packing their belongings. By the time everything was ready, the sun had already risen. Thankfully, despite the hustle and bustle of the evening, no further incidents occurred.\n\nThe journey back was uneventful, and upon reaching Ganggang Camp, the village was bustling as if celebrating the New Year. Families had summoned their menfolk back from their labors on Ox Heart Mountain, and every household stewed pork with glass noodles.\n\nThat evening, Fatty and I sat cross-legged on the Kang in Yanzi's home, drinking with Yanzi's father. We had barely had a few drinks when we heard shouting outside, and even the village hunting dogs joined in the commotion. My intuition told me once again that something had gone wrong, and it was likely no small matter.\n\nStepping outside, we saw the Branch Secretary going from door to door, banging on them and calling people out: \"This is terrible! There's been a landslide on Ox Heart Mountain, and the archaeological team is trapped inside. Everyone, quickly grab your tools and let's go rescue them!\"\n\nI only came to understand the details of this incident much later. It turned out that within the ancient tomb's underground palace on Ox Heart Mountain, layer upon layer was revealed. Archaeology, unlike tomb raiding, is not so straightforward or convenient. The archaeological team would excavate one level and then clean it, a process both time-consuming and laborious, while also clearing the surrounding chariot and horse pits, sacrificial burial pits, and other types of burial pits. It was only upon reaching the seventh underground layer that the archaeologists finally uncovered the coffin of the Empress Dowager.\n\nChina's policy on ancient tomb excavation is protective in nature, meaning that tombs are never actively excavated. Only when construction, earthquakes, tomb raiding, or other factors threaten the existence of ancient tombs are archaeologists dispatched to the site for emergency excavations.\n\n The ancient tomb from the Liao Dynasty at Lama Gully's Ox Heart Mountain is of such a nature that an earthquake caused the mountain to split open, revealing the underground palace within. Over the course of several years, as the archaeological team excavated, more than three thousand cultural relics have been unearthed. The mysterious veil of the final layer of the underground palace is also about to be lifted.\n\nHowever, just as the seventh layer of the underground palace was breached, those in the village who had been collecting Western relics returned to Ganggang Camp. In celebration, they sent for their family members who were working at the archaeology site, asking to take a few days off. Normally, with the project's progress being extremely tight and the shortage of hands, leaves were hardly granted except during the festive seasons. That day, as if by some whimsical fate, since the underground palace had been dug down to the last layer with no major tasks remaining, the manager approved the leave for everyone, leaving only a dozen members of the archaeological team to clean up the seventh layer of the underground palace.\n\nThe workers from the village had barely left when a landslide occurred. The year of the earthquake, the mountain had cracked from the bottom up, and the waterfall at the mountain's peak had dried up from that time. The cracked part of the mountain, possibly hollow inside, could not withstand the pressure and the outward tension after opening, or perhaps it was related to the team digging too deep into the mountain, resulting in a very serious landslide accident. Eleven members of the archaeological team who were inside clearing the tomb master's coffin were buried within.\n\nThis incident was not reported to Ganggang Camp until half a day later. We only knew that there had been a collapse that trapped many people. It was a half-day's journey from there to Lama Gully, and we knew that even if we went, we wouldn't arrive in time to rescue anyone. But we could not neglect our duty, for those buried beneath were comrades sent by the organization to work there.\n\nThe branch secretary organized a rescue team while sending someone to notify the medical station in the banner. Fatty and I joined in, and after digging at Ox Heart Mountain for two days and nights, everyone had to accept the grim reality. The leaders from the banner arrived and, seeing the situation, knew there was no hope. The only thing left to do was to excavate the bodies of the victims for burial.\n\nThere was something peculiar about the situation. The mountain had not collapsed earlier or later but just after the villagers had taken leave, sparing most of them from the disaster. This could be seen as a fortunate stroke of luck amidst misfortune. In the grand scheme of things, there seems to be a divine will at play, though who can truly make sense of it.\n\n So, over fifty people stayed behind to continue their slow excavation on the mountain, while the rest of the elderly, women, and children returned to the village. This delay lasted another three or four days. Not wanting to linger any longer, I bid farewell to everyone and, accompanied by Fatty, made my way back to the long-missed Beijing.\n\nUpon disembarking from the train, we didn't go anywhere else but headed straight for Panjiayuan. Big Gold Tooth was just as before, insufferably vulgar with a mercenary air about him. Unassuming as he might seem, he was actually a seasoned and experienced expert in Panjiayuan.\n\nThe moment Big Gold Tooth spotted us, he quickly set aside his business and bombarded us with questions, \"Gentlemen, how come it took you so many days to return? I almost died of longing.\"\n\nFatty was itching to take out the two jade bi disks to show him and finally find out their worth, a question that had been troubling us both. Today, we hoped to get to the bottom of it.\n\nBig Gold Tooth quickly signaled to us with his eyes, hinting not to take out the items: \"Let's head to Dongsi instead. That restaurant where we had the mutton hotpot last time is quite nice and quiet. Panjiayuan is a mixed bag, crowded with watchful eyes; it's not the place for confidential talks. We can't afford to reveal the burial artifacts here. Just give me a moment to wrap up this deal, and we'll be on our way.\"\n\nThe 'burial artifacts' Big Gold Tooth referred to was industry jargon, as I've mentioned before. It's a synonym for 'burial artifact,' not specifically pertaining to antiques from the Ming Dynasty. It's a euphemism for burial artifacts in general, much like the terms 'antique' or 'antiques'\u2014all related to grave robbing. In earlier times, they were simply called 'antiques' or 'bone artifacts,' denoting relics left from previous dynasties.\n\nWhile we chatted, Big Gold Tooth managed to offload an early Qing Dynasty icebox and a Yongzheng-era official kiln marked rainbow small teapot to a foreigner accompanied by a Chinese translator. These items weren't particularly significant, just trifles really. We didn't see the exact price, but I reckoned the foreigner must have been fleeced.\n\nAfter closing the deal, Big Gold Tooth counted his money: \"Three days without business, and today's take is enough for three years of living. These foolish foreigners, buying a couple of fake goods as if they've found treasure, they can go home and cry. After counting his money, he turned to me and said, \"Back during the Year of the Metal Rat, when the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, they didn't hesitate to swipe good things from us. Today, I reckon I've done a bit of heavenly justice. Master Hu, wouldn't you say that's the right reasoning?\"\n\n Fatty and I, presently seeking his assistance, naturally deferred to him. I promptly picked up the conversation, praising Big Thumb: \"In ancient times, Huo Yuanjia triumphed in a martial arts competition, defeating the Russian strongman. Today, we have Lord Jin, who cunningly appropriates the ill-gotten wealth of foreigners, a true glory for our country. His feats are indeed lofty.\"\n\nAfter gathering our belongings, we once again visited the small restaurant where we first conversed. Big Gold Tooth might have made a tidy sum today, and buoyed by our flattery, he seemed quite elated. While drinking, he even recited a couple of lines from a Peking opera in a dramatic fashion: \"You wretched foreign slave, I shall beat you with my steel whip, wah ya ya ya ya!\"\n\nLooking around, I noted that it wasn't the peak hour for dining; the restaurant was cold and clear, with only our table tucked in the corner. A waiter dozed off on the counter, and two attendants responsible for the hot pot squatted at the entrance chatting away, paying no attention to the three of us.\n\nI then asked Fatty to take out the jade bi and show it to Big Gold Tooth, also briefly recounting the key points of our journey to the Northeast. Big Gold Tooth examined it meticulously, occasionally bringing it to his nose to sniff and even licking it with his tongue, inquiring about the details of the ancient tomb we explored.\n\nBig Gold Tooth remarked, \"When it comes to antique appraisal, I only know the basics\u2014it's a craft handed down by my ancestors. Today, I shall display my humble skills. When such an item arrives, it's like a traditional doctor taking a pulse; there's also an inspection to be done, especially with funerary objects. Unlike common antiques, which are often handled and acquire a sheen over time, funerary objects are unearthed from grave robbing and have always been buried in ancient tombs. There's also talk of new and old tombs, water tombs, and dirty fights among grave robbers, known as 'Old Dipper'. First, we look at the craftsmanship, the shape, and the color. Next is smelling, which is a crucial step in identifying funerary objects. In the south, forgeries are aged by soaking in fecal pits, but while the color may age, the smell is distinctly different. It's more putrid than the scent of an ancient corpse's fart sealed inside with jade plugs to prevent the leakage of corpse qi and thus decay. The appearance might seem authentically aged, but one whiff can reveal the truth, fooling no expert's nose. Then there's asking: where does the item come from, and what is its provenance? Grave robbers naturally detail from which tomb the item was pilfered, allowing me to judge whether their account is true or false and if there are any flaws. This also helps to indirectly assess the item's authenticity and value. Lastly, it's about feeling with the hands, a realm that can only be understood and not conveyed in words. Countless antiques have passed through my hands, which are connected to my heart. A true antique, a treasure, regardless of its size or weight, can be felt through a heft, a touch, a pinch. This 'weight' isn't about the actual mass of the object. Antiques possess a spirit and a sense of profound weightiness accumulated over hundreds, even thousands of years. Fake goods, no matter how well-crafted, can never replicate this sensation.\"\n\n Fatty exclaimed, \"Oh my goodness, you've said so much and I haven't understood a single word. Please, just tell us, how much are these two burial objects worth?\"\n\nBig Gold Tooth chuckled heartily, \"Fat Master is getting anxious. I admit I've been rambling a bit, but it's all with good intentions. I hope that both of you will learn more about the knowledge of antiques appraisal in the future. After all, ancient large tombs contain hundreds, if not thousands, of burial artifacts. Without some understanding of this area, it will be difficult to make informed decisions in the future. Now, let me talk about these two burial objects. I can't name them exactly, but let's give them a provisional title based on their appearance: we can call them 'Moth-bodied Chi-patterned Double Dagger-shaped Bi.' As for their value...\"\n\nAntiques, you see, don't have a fixed price, unlike sugar or coal, which have a set price per pound. The value of antique collectibles is very subjective; as long as there's a buyer who values the item, it becomes valuable. Otherwise, no matter how exquisite the object is, if there's no buyer, it's essentially worthless.\n\nFor these two burial objects, I'll give you a baseline estimate. Based solely on their own merit, they would be valued between forty and fifty thousand yuan in the domestic market. Of course, their value would be significantly higher overseas, but this is the going rate in our country right now. When it comes time to sell, if there is a suitable buyer, the price could go much higher. It's hard to say exactly, as it will depend on the circumstances at the time.\n\n Big Gold Tooth mentioned that he once knew a fellow trader at Panjiayuan who dealt in all sorts of trinkets like tile pendants, arrow clusters, old coins, emblems, calligraphy supplies, iconography, and snuff bottles. Eventually, that guy shifted his business and started dealing in mummies out in Xinjiang. Now, he's made a fortune.\n\nFatty, puzzled, asked, \"But aren't mummies just desiccated corpses? How could they be worth anything?\"\n\nBig Gold Tooth explained, \"Not at all. What we see as just dried-up mummies, the international market sees as treasures. In Beijing, any mummy predating the Ming Dynasty goes for twenty thousand, but once it's taken abroad, it's worth a hundred thousand, my friend. Think about it. Foreigners are fascinated by such exotic curiosities. To them, our ancient Eastern land is shrouded in mystery. For instance, imagine the Natural History Museum in New York advertising an exhibition of a 'Mysterious Eastern Beauty Mummy' \u2013 it would cause a sensation. This mummy craze was sparked by last year's discovery of the Loulan female mummy at the Xiaoriver Tomb Cluster in Loulan. Even domestically, just put up an exhibition anywhere, and you'll have people lining up to see it. That's what I call a business opportunity.\"\n\nAfter hearing this, both Fatty and I had an epiphany, nodding in agreement. We realized there was so much more to this than meets the eye. It's true what they say: without speaking, nothing is clear; without lighting, nothing shines. Plus, knowing that the two jade bi disks we had were worth around fifty thousand each, we felt our efforts hadn't been in vain.\n\nI then inquired, \"Lord Jin, what did you call that burial object again? It had such a tongue-twisting name.\"\n\nBig Gold Tooth filled my cup with beer and said, \"Don't rush. We've got all the time in the world today. Let me explain it slowly. It's called a moth-bodied, chi-patterned, double dagger-shaped bi. In our antique business, there's a rule: if an item doesn't have an official name, it's named based on its features.\"\n\n\"Just like the famous national treasure, the Zenghou Yi Chime Bells. This musical instrument certainly wasn't called by this name in the past. However, what it was originally called is now hard to verify. So, archaeologists named it based on the tomb it was excavated from and the type of instrument it is.\"\n\n This moth-bodied, chi-patterned, double dagger-shaped bi disc, its very name already encapsulates all of its distinctive features. Resembling a pair of moths, it was unearthed from the tomb of a Jurchen general. In ancient times, such moths symbolized warriors who would willingly sacrifice themselves. There's a saying, isn't there? Like a moth to a flame, they go without return, knowingly embracing death with open arms and resolute courage.\n\nNowadays, we're aware that moths, being unable to see, are merely drawn to the light. But the ancients didn't see it that way. They held in high esteem the spirit of these large moths, crafting accessories in their likeness to honor those who had distinguished themselves in battle. Wearing such an ornament was a mark of glory.\n\nLook at the patterns on this piece, known as the Chiwen Pattern. It resembles the head of a lion and the body of a tiger, yet it is neither. The chi is a type of hornless dragon, and objects engraved with the Chiwen Pattern were believed to ward off evil spirits. Not long ago, a Ming Dynasty prince's tomb was excavated on Mount Mujia in Yunnan. You might have heard tales of the valiant heroes of the Ming in storybooks. Among Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's generals was one named Mu Ying. The tomb unearthed belonged to this very Prince Mu, and inside, a pair of jade double chi bi discs similar to the ones you've discovered were found. In modern terms, these would be akin to medals or military decorations.\n\nLet's talk about this pair. As the name implies, they come as a set, which is significant. Such adornments were meant to be hung on either side of a helmet, so only a pair holds value; a single piece is worthless.\n\nThe worth of this moth-bodied, chi-patterned, double dagger-shaped bi pair lies primarily in their historical and aesthetic value rather than the material itself, which is not particularly precious. They are made from a type of pale yellow variegated flint from the Caucasus region, not true jade. Although, if one insists on classifying it among jades, it wouldn't be entirely incorrect. High-quality pale yellow is quite valuable, changing into twelve distinct colors over the course of twelve hours \u2013 but the material of this particular pair is not of the finest grade.\n\nAh, there's an inscription here. The name Zi Ma is carved upon it, suggesting he was the owner of this pair of bi discs. This man appears to have been a marshal and the Left Supervisor of the Army during the late Jurchen period. During a siege, he reputedly killed over two hundred Mongol soldiers with his bow, displaying extraordinary valor before ultimately dying in battle. He was quite a figure, and legend has it that the Jurchen ruler exchanged his body from the Mongols for a hundred thousand taels of gold.\n\nListening to this feels like deciphering a myth. There are comprehensible parts, but not many. Fatty, uninterested in listening further, simply busied himself with the hotpot, sliding slices of beef tripe, lamb, chicken, and an assortment of vegetables and mushrooms into the simmering broth. Weary of grilled meats from recent days, he was eager for a change. Today, with the chance to indulge in lamb hotpot, he set to it with gusto, focusing solely on one thing: eating.\n\n I asked Big Gold Tooth what was hot in the antique market these days, something that could fetch a high price.\n\nBig Gold Tooth replied, \"The Westerners call our country's products porcelain, and it's safe to say that porcelain is always the hottest commodity in the antiques trade. The porcelain produced during the most glorious periods of Chinese history is unparalleled, even by modern advanced craftsmanship. Have you heard of Chenghua porcelain, for example? Especially the painted Chenghua porcelain\u2014it's the cream of the crop. They don't have to be big; just a tiny piece, no bigger than a three-year-old child's toy, can be worth a hundred thousand yuan at Panjiayuan Market, no haggling necessary. You just mentioned that a lot of pottery and porcelain was found in the ancient tombs at the Black Wind Pass near the Sino-Mongolian Border, but it's a pity they weren't excavated. Those must be from the late Northern Song Dynasty. What a shame! I hate to say something you might not want to hear, don't take it the wrong way, but you've missed the mark this time. Those unexcavated jars and pots are worth far more than the moth-bodied, chi-patterned double dagger-shaped bi you've found. So, you two still have a lot to learn. Take the opportunity to come with me next time I go to the countryside to collect items. You'll see the tricks of the trade. After one successful trip, you could easily net a few million.\"\n\nI agreed repeatedly and said to Big Gold Tooth, \"I've actually been considering a bold idea. Next time, we'll go for a big haul, solve our problems in one go. Tomb raiding in the deep mountains and old forests is far riskier than in the mainland. No matter how many lives one might have, they can't withstand such wear and tear. I plan to target a top-grade feng shui treasure\u2014a large tomb. But this is no child's play. I need to prepare thoroughly beforehand, or I might not be able to handle it.\"\n\nBig Gold Tooth asked, \"Master Hu, are you serious about hitting a big target? Have you chosen one yet?\"\n\nI replied, \"No, the thought just crossed my mind. Large tombs in remote areas are extremely hard to find. Right now, I'm like a farmer, knowing only how to read the feng shui and locate the pulse of the land, completely clueless about historical and archaeological value assessments. I'm very blind in choosing targets and I'm not eager to act immediately. Our recent actions were a bit too hasty for quick success. We can't keep doing these short-term stunts. However, it's a double-edged sword. Although we didn't unearth any major items in the northeast this time, we did gain some experience and funds. It could be considered a practice run at grave robbing.\"\n\nBig Gold Tooth said, \"Hearing you talk like this reminds me suddenly of something about Xinjiang...\""
